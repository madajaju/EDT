Alan Chalker, Ph.D., is Director of Strategic Programs at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), as well as Director of Awesim, OSC’s industry outreach program. In this role he is responsible for all non-academic client relationships for OSC.

He also coordinates the preparation and submission of many of the center’s grant proposals and manages a variety of smaller research projects, serving as the PI or co-PI on several funded programs at any given time, including OSC's widely adopted Open OnDemand platform.

Additional responsibilities include helping to coordinate OSC’s appearance at the annual supercomputing conference and being the Co-Director of OSC’s Summer Institute program for high school students, of which he is an alumnus.

Chalker previously served as assistant academic lead for the Department of Defense’s (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program in the areas of Integrated Modeling & Test Environments and Signal & Image Processing. In this role, he coordinated a small team of researchers at OSC that worked on DoD projects and training courses involving technologies, such as parallel high-level languages, data sharing and mining and SIP algorithm parallelization.

In 2006, Chalker won the semiannual MATLAB programming contest, which is held by the Mathworks and involves dozens of MATLAB expert programmers from around the world competing against each other over a week-long period.

Prior to OSC, Chalker spent five years as the lead controls engineer with a public company, Embrex Inc. At Embrex, he worked on a research and development project developing an automated chicken gender determination process, receiving three federal patents.

In 1998, Chalker earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from The Ohio State University. He received a doctoral degree in biomedical engineering at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2005.
