In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses are constantly required to adapt and innovate. One individual who deeply understands this changing landscape is Dr. Madeleine Wallace, who experienced first-hand the significant impact of digital transformation while growing up in rural Peru. Her experiences have shaped her professional approach, leading her to develop the Snapshot Evaluate, Act, and Monitor (SEAM) Framework to facilitate effective organizational change.

## SEAM Framework: Setting the Stage for Change

Digital transformation is an inevitable reality for contemporary companies and can either lead to tremendous growth or an abrupt downfall depending on how well businesses navigate this era of change. Dr. Wallace's past experiences, notably the closure of her parent's vocational school due to failed adaptation to digitalization, made her realize the central role of readiness in the process of transformation. It set the stage for her development of the SEAM Framework.

The SEAM approach proposes an action-focused plan that kickstarts with taking a realistic snapshot, a detailed assessment, of the existing state of a corporation. It encourages leaders to ask insightful questions about what's functioning well and what isn't, analyzing strengths, weaknesses, and the obstacles to change. The overall aim is to establish a truthful picture of the organization, defining the starting point for a successful change strategy.

## Evaluation and Actuation: Implementing the SEAM Approach

Evaluation and actuation are the next crucial steps in the SEAM Framework. Once a snapshot has been taken, the evaluation phase utilizes this information to determine the steps required for a successful transformation. It presents an opportunity to develop a detailed plan, noting the representation of barriers, and defining the actions needed to overcome these obstacles.

During the actuation phase, the organization moves forward with implementing these proposed changes. At this stage, recognition, and acceptance of the identified issues become critical. Dr. Wallace emphasizes the need to be open to address underlying problems and, if needed, bring in external consultants to provide expertise beyond the existing capabilities of the organization.

## Monitoring the Implementation

Following the implementation comes the monitoring phase. This stage involves tracking and reviewing all changes to ensure their effectiveness and positive impact. It serves as a way to measure the success of the transformation, and if required, adjust the strategies to better achieve the objectives.

## Digital Transformation: A Necessity

Acknowledging and addressing the potential difficulties and obstacles to change is a key ingredient in successful digital transformation. Particularly now, the shift to digital integration is not an easy task. It often requires bringing in external experts to help identify potential blind spots. Adapting Dr. Wallace's SEAM framework can provide an insightful and practical approach to assessing and implementing change efficiently.

Dr. Wallace's insights on organizational change in the digital age reflect an important message for businesses today: embrace digital transformation, assess existing practices, act upon necessary changes and monitor their effectiveness. After all, readiness and adaptability are the keys to surviving and thriving in the digital era.
