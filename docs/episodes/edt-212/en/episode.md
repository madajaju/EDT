## Bringing Gen AI to the Masses

Zach, hailing from Ohio, is on a mission to democratize Gen AI. His diverse professional background has endowed him with a profound understanding of community dynamics. Zach firmly believes that Gen AI, with its potential to revolutionize everyday life, is not just for tech-savvy individuals, but for everyone.

One crucial insight that emerged was the necessity of imparting AI knowledge to people of all ages and regions. It's not merely about coding or creating AI but ensuring its seamless integration into our daily lives. This human-centric approach is a cornerstone for the ethical and successful application of AI in real-world situations.

## Everyday Applications of AI: Cooking & Budgeting 

Zach highlighted how AI can be used in everyday tasks like cooking. He used AI to create a monthly cookbook filled with various recipes. One of the significant benefits of Generative AI is its flexibility. For instance, if you want to cook a gluten-free family meal for under $10, an AI assistant could help you find the right recipe and even provide relevant coupons from your chosen store.

AI models like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are gaining popularity due to their user-friendly interfaces and reliable outputs. However, it's crucial to remember that no AI model is infallible. It's our responsibility to critically evaluate and verify the results produced by these technologies, empowering us to make informed decisions.

## Gen AI in Community Development

Zach introduced his collaborative project with Mayor Johnson in Somerset, Ohio, which is a visionary drive to bridge the digital divide in the village. They are working together to produce fact-filled videos about Generative AI targeted at seniors. The idea is to familiarize this demographic with technological advancements and offer them more growth opportunities.

This initiative, known as the Somerset Builder's Club, aims to retain local talent by offering them a platform to interact with advanced technology solutions. Embedding the younger generation into these initiatives is pivotal, given their adaptive nature and ability to master new technologies.

## Key Takeaways

The application of AI spans far and wide, from making our everyday tasks more manageable to reshaping societal development. With forward-thinking leaders like Mayor Johnson at the helm and AI enthusiasts like Zach, the digital divide can be bridged, and AI can benefit the masses. Keep tuning into our podcast to stay updated on the world of technology.
