            As a child neurologist, Dr. Follett emphasizes the importance of understanding the brain's developmental processes and its remarkable ability to overcome even catastrophic injuries. She shares how her extensive research involved studying rat models and cell cultures to gain insight into children's development and search for ways to help them get the best outcomes, despite injuries or illnesses. Listening to Dr. Follett's insights and experiences allows for a better understanding of how neurology is critical in understanding the brain's processes and how we can better appreciate and support brain development, particularly in children. Dr. Follett also shares her unexpected appearance at a high-tech show, where she utilized her neurology expertise to help a man experiencing seizures during a keynote address. This podcast highlights the potential reach of neurology beyond just medical institutions and the essential role of neurologists in understanding the complexity of the human brain.

Have you ever needed help understanding a complex technology or product, even though you just needed to know how to use it? Dr. has found that her skills in explaining medical problems to patients translate well into explaining complex technologies to non-experts. Her work as a neuroscientist studying brain development led her and her husband to start a high-tech startup that does neuromorphic computing, called Lewis-Rhodes Labs. One of their products, Extreme Search, uses a neuromorphic processor to search through massive amounts of data, mimicking how a brain rapidly recognizes and processes information.

Dr. Follet emphasizes that there are better approaches than mimicking a brain when creating technology. While brains make thousands of mistakes daily, we don't necessarily want our computers to do the same. Instead, we can take careful lessons from how brains work and apply them to create more efficient and effective technology. This experience highlights the importance of interdisciplinary skills and thinking outside of one's specific field. By finding skills that transfer across different areas and industries, we can bring unique perspectives and solutions to complex problems.

Extreme search technology is a breakthrough in cyber forensics and real-time analysis that solves the challenge of sifting through Petabytes of unstructured data in record time using cutting-edge hardware and software. Extreme search technology offers high performance, low power consumption, and a constant throughput and is modeled after the human brain designed for high-performance data processing.

Unlike traditional data search methods that require moving data around, extreme search technology allows on-site searches that eliminate all network bottlenecks. The technology suits cyber forensics, cybersecurity, legal discovery, and enterprise data search. Extreme search technology is straightforward for users and requires no new language or pre-identification of patterns but instead uses regular expressions to perform ad-hoc searches of any data described in the text.

Extreme search technology performs sensitive searches on storage appliances and provides real-time analysis identifying potential threats in milliseconds. Combined with traditional detection methods, the technology can detect advanced persistent threats, viruses, adware, trojans, worms, rootkits, and other malware quickly.  The use of Extreme Search technology is not limited to cyber forensics. Other research fields, such as genomic research or any unstructured data field, can benefit from Extreme Search technology's ability to search vast amounts of miscellaneous data in record time.

Many organizations need help finding patterns or insights within their data. Or they have vast databases and struggle to find anything because of the sheer amount of information. Many data scientists resort to indices to decrease the time to find information. This works well when you know what you want when collecting or storing the data. However, many organizations deal with opaque data that fits outside a predetermined structure. In this case, brute-force searches of petabytes of data can take weeks to find common patterns of data not previously determined.

Extreme search technology helps bring visibility to new data areas, allowing for improved analysis and analytics that start with the search and can go faster if data is transformed into the required pieces. This is particularly useful when dealing with healthcare data, where there are massive amounts of structured data, yet information fits outside any database structure.
