GPA (Global Presence Alliance) was founded 15 years ago to address the need for a better model in the collaboration space. At the time, video conferencing was becoming more prevalent, and organizations were considering a global strategy. However, they needed more options - relying on regional integrators or dealing with a complex setup that needed to understand collaboration truly.

## People, Space, and Technology

GPA aimed to solve this problem by providing a comprehensive global collaboration and video strategy approach. They recognized the need to balance people, space, and technology to create exceptional collaborative experiences. By bridging the gap between different regions and understanding the unique requirements of each organization, GPA offered a better alternative to existing solutions.

While technology has evolved over the years, there is still work to achieve true collaboration. Microsoft, for example, has introduced signature rooms that mimic the telepresence room concept at a fraction of the cost. However, nonverbal cues and physical interaction are still challenging to replicate in virtual environments. As the technology advances, we will see improvements in the collaborative experience. Until then, organizations like GPA are crucial in finding innovative solutions and helping businesses navigate the ever-changing digital transformation landscape.

There still are challenges in video collaboration technologies. However, new advances in technology are overcoming some of those challenges. One of the biggest is the whiteboard brainstorming session.   Due to camera angles and other limitations, integrating whiteboarding experiences into video calls is still unnatural. However, efforts are being made to create more natural and integrated expertise using AI and camera technology. Technology can provide a second-best experience; it cannot replace the personal and emotional experience of being physically in the same room as someone. This human element includes things like water cooler conversations and the ability to touch and feel objects.

## Unique Business Model

GPA has a unique business model; it takes a bottom-up approach, with business units in 50 countries working as shareholders in a parent entity. This allows them to achieve global scale while maintaining cultural awareness and diversity.

When implementing collaboration strategies for multinational companies, the company takes a programmatic rather than project-based approach. They have centralized teams for account management, project management, and solution architecture while relying on regional teams for deployment and support. This collaborative approach reflects the company's philosophy and is crucial for success in implementing complex collaboration technologies.

## COVID-19

There was a profound shift in the collaboration world before and after COVID-19. Pre-COVID, most of our work and collaboration were done in physical office spaces, but with the pandemic, everyone was forced to work remotely. This shift in the work environment required a change in thinking and approach.

In the past, remote participants were often treated as second-class citizens, but now, with the increase in remote collaboration, the experience has become more equalized. People have gotten used to the virtual meeting experience and expect a similar experience when they return to physical meeting spaces. This has led to a demand for a better experience in the office.

The shift to remote work has also highlighted the importance of understanding human factors in the workspace. Different individuals have different needs and preferences when it comes to their work environment. For example, some people may find noise distracting, while others may thrive in an open and collaborative space. Understanding these human factors and aligning technology with people's needs has become even more crucial.

Organizations are still experimenting and learning how to create effective collaborative spaces. The industry is also starting to focus on collecting actual data to understand the true impacts and manage the outcomes of these collaborative spaces.

The shift to remote work during COVID-19 has necessitated a change in thinking and approach to collaboration. There is a demand for a better experience in remote and physical meeting spaces and a need to understand human factors in the workspace. The industry is still experimenting and learning, and there is a focus on collecting actual data to manage and improve collaboration outcomes.

## Future Vision

In the future, the office space will be more focused on creating meaningful experiences and fostering human connections. The primary attraction of the office will be the presence of other people and the opportunity to have face-to-face interactions that can't be replicated through video conferencing. Microsoft is leading the way in utilizing AI and data to make predictions and recommendations that enhance the office experience.

Additionally, the office space will have a greater emphasis on wellness. Employees may need access to optimal furniture or amenities in their home offices, so providing a dedicated space for focused work can contribute to overall health. Sustainability is also a factor to consider, as staying at home may only sometimes be the most energy-efficient option.

Regarding technology, chat, and collaboration platforms will be crucial in facilitating communication and collaboration among hybrid workers. AI and camera technologies will enhance meeting room experiences by automating specific tasks and creating a more immersive environment. There will also be an increase in media production capabilities, with more companies creating their narrowcasting channels for both internal and external communication.

Overall, the future of the office will be a balance between leveraging technology and prioritizing human connections and experiences. It won't be a one-size-fits-all approach but a customized space that reflects the company's care and concern for its employees.

## Bring People Back to the Office

Byron acknowledges that getting customers out of their office spaces can be challenging, just as much as it is for employees. When attracting people to a physical location, it is essential to consider the entire ecosystem of partners and customers. This highlights the need to create spaces and experiences that are enjoyable and enticing for everyone involved.

Byron also emphasizes the human factor in collaboration and AV (audiovisual) technology. He points out that his theater and stage management background has given him a unique perspective on the importance of human interaction and engagement. He believes the human factor makes collaboration and AV technology impactful and successful.
