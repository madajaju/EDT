Amidst the ever-evolving world of technology, the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity has sparked a compelling discourse. Today, we delve into insights from a thought-provoking conversation with Steve Orrin, the esteemed CTO of Intel Federal. We explore the security implications of AI and the innovative strides being made to establish a secure AI ecosystem.

## Securing the AI

In the realm of AI, the paramount task is to secure the solution and its pipeline. The dynamic nature of AI necessitates a broader scope of surveillance, extending beyond the management of static applications. This vigilance encompasses data sources, evolving models, and weight changes that influence AI outcomes, presenting a formidable challenge.

The security struggles are further aggravated by unreliable data input from various sources. Conventional cybersecurity techniques have proven to be inadequate when fighting against AI manipulation and interference. Given this complexity, the concept of continuous testing and validation of AI emerges as a plausible solution. The constant testing approach helps identify manipulative instances in the AI's learning process by regularly monitoring the ‘confidence levels’ and aiding the reinforcement of its original training. 

## Bringing Pre-Deployment Strategy Post-Deployment 

The concept of continuous validation presents a challenging perspective. As per the DevSecOps rule, isolation and separation of environments are essential. However, constant development is the norm in AI, making it almost necessary to import pre-deployment testing methods into post-deployment stages. This approach births the idea of integrating the testing aspect of development right into the production environment, fostering a more secure AI operation. 

## The AI Security Impact

Understanding the evolving nature of AI models is crucial. AI, significantly influenced by its operating environment, requires an enduring testing regimen during pre and post-deployment phases to mitigate the risk of possible piecemeal attacks. 

Despite its complexities, the confluence of AI and cybersecurity offers a fresh technological frontier. A balance must be struck between acknowledging and harnessing AI’s vast potential to bolster cybersecurity while simultaneously striving to secure AI itself.

As we navigate this digital era, it's crucial for startups, businesses, and those interested in emerging tech trends to take early steps to embrace the changes. We're not talking about ‘if’, but ‘when’. By preparing now, we cannot only tackle the challenges posed by AI security but also leverage the exciting opportunities this frontier offers. 

Now, we invite you to share your thoughts. How do you plan to incorporate AI into your security measures? What protective steps are you taking for your AI solutions? Your insights are valuable to us and to the wider community. Join the discussion below and let's learn from each other!
