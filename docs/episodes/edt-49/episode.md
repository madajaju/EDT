<p>They identified four areas that have helped them not only survive but excel during this unusual time: Anticipate your manager's needs, Communicate like your job depends on it (because it for sure does), Wave your flag by waving the flag for others, Block! That! Calendar!</p>
<p></p><h2> Anticipate your manager's needs</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><ul><li> Guess what reporting your manager needs and have the information at your fingertips.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Sales reports, project status, and customer status should be proactively created.</li></ul>
</p>
<p></p><h2> Communicate like your job depends on it (because it for sure does)</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><ul><li> Do not fill other's email box with useless information</li></ul>
<ul><li> Put your ask at the beginning of the email. Then add backup information.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Give your team a summary of what you are doing with helpful information.</li></ul>
</p>
<p></p><h2> Wave your flag by waving the flag for others</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><ul><li> A key component of success at any company is having visible, tangible accomplishments.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You cannot always put your head down and work and hope it speaks for itself.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Recognize others that helped you close the deal or finish the project.</li></ul>
</p>
<p></p><h2> Block! That! Calendar!</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><ul><li> Set boundaries for family time and when work ends and begins.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Block off time for "you" time. You need time to rest your brain.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Set 5-10 minutes break between meetings,</li></ul>
<ul><li> Time to process your inbox</li></ul>
<ul><li> Time at the end of the day to process your day</li></ul>
