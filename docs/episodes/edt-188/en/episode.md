# Embracing Digital Transformation: A Business Survival Strategy

In an era of rapid technological advancements, digital transformation no longer remains a luxury; it's now a necessity to ensure business continuity. A testament to this reality is the story of the **Burgess Institute**, a Spanish language school for adults located in the heart of New York City.

## Swift Pivot to Online Learning

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for a rapid transition from traditional to online classes became imminent. Leveraging their digital infrastructure, Burgess Institute managed to make this shift seamlessly within a time span of two days.

Influenced by the precautionary measures and social distancing rules, nearly 70% of students had already begun taking online courses. However, the decision to completely close in-person classes in cities like New York and Chicago was both a challenging and game-changing turning point for the establishment. Despite fears of losing students due to the lack of in-person interaction, the majority remained steadfast and loyal to the online program.

## Reshaping Work Dynamics and Broadening Reach 

One of the positive aspects of this dramatic transition is the reshaping of work dynamics. Burgess Institute's education providers were given the flexibility to teach from their homes or even from across the world. This new operational mode was positively embraced by the teaching staff, resulting in an improvement in performance and overall work satisfaction.

Simultaneously, the shift to online classes introduced Burgess Institute to a broader demographic. No longer limited by the geographic bounds of the United States, they now had the opportunity to tap into various English speaking markets globally. They have reached out to students in Europe, Australia, Canada, India, and the Emirates, thereby expanding their influence as a renowned Language institute.

## Understanding Business Processes and Coding

Despite the successful transition, the road to digital transformation was not devoid of challenges. Operating a code base as a small business was seen as a significant hurdle. The founder and managing director of Burgess Institute, Dan Burgess, emphasized the need for business owners to possess at least a basic understanding of coding and programming. 

By investing time to understand the business's processes prior to jumping into the coding phase, businesses can ensure that the code base created is maintainable. Building a strong relationship with developers who profoundly understand your business logic is indispensable during this process.

## Adapting Business Workflows for Digital Structure

The key takeaway from the Burgess Institute's digital transformation story is the importance of adapting existing business workflows to complement your impending digital structure. It's vital to understand that a traditional business model can't always be translated accurately into a digital platform.

In conclusion, the navigation journey from brick and mortar to online business may initially seem daunting. But with the right tools, mindset, and understanding of your business's core processes, a successful digital transition is certainly achievable. As Burgess Institute has demonstrated, embracing digital transformation is more than just a survival strategy â€” it's a path to growth and expansion in today's digital era.
