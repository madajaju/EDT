Digital transformation has become a buzzword in business, with companies investing heavily in new technology solutions to optimize their operations. However, despite the benefits of these technologies, many companies still need help to keep up with the pace of change and fully utilize the potential of their investments.

Andrew Cohen, managing director of Netsurit and former CEO of Evoke, has dedicated his career to helping companies innovate and embrace digital transformation. Cohen leads Netsurit Automate, an innovation team that creates automation to help companies accelerate better processes and improvements.

Netsurit Automate's approach to innovation as a service, where perpetual innovation and perpetual agility are key. The team identifies areas of challenge from manual, repetitive processes, disparate systems, and workforces that need to communicate better and create solutions that leverage technology investments. They help implement the solutions and look for opportunities to help with customer experiences.

One of the critical factors in helping organizations automate their process improvement is identifying the organization’s “Jackrabbits” and “Junkers.” “Jack Rabbits” are people or teams that move so fast, adopting new technology and automation, that they overlook important details, creating solutions that don’t solve the whole problem. On the other hand, “Junkers” are bureaucratic organizations that resist change at all costs, thwarting any automation or process improvement. Cohen’s organization aims to create what he coins “Juggernauts” that have the best of both worlds.

Cohen emphasizes that his team acts as a third-party agnostic team to identify and address issues with ad hoc processes and help companies scale, creating their Juggernauts. They provide process re-engineering and process automation services to help organizations optimize their processes, focusing on finding the most feasible solution for maximum value, which may only sometimes involve automation. They also help companies improve collaboration and user adoption of existing technology through a high-engagement model.

One of the challenges that many companies face in digital transformation is keeping up with the latest technology tools and investing in Microsoft solutions. Cohen notes that many companies may have invested in Microsoft licenses but don’t utilize the technology to its full potential. Netsurit Automate partners with enterprise clients to implement modernization opportunities and hyper-automation solutions, working alongside the enterprise teams.

The team at Netsurit Automate has a unique approach to delivering solutions. They identify the business problem and measure the ROI before building, then continue to measure and chart the solution's effectiveness post-delivery. This approach ensures that their solutions deliver ROI and have skin in the game.

Cohen shares two examples of successful process automation solutions for two companies in supply chain management. One example is a mobile app that simplifies and automates a centralized email inbox for a company with a force of 5,000 field sales. The app reduced response time from 24-48 hours to 3-4 minutes, freeing employees from doing email triage and allowing them to focus on more valuable work. Another example is an inventory management dashboard for a medical device manufacturer, which unexpectedly changed the whole sales methodology and made the sales fulfillment process quicker.

Innovation is critical for companies to remain competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. Netsurit Automate's approach to innovation as a service provides companies with perpetual innovation and perpetual agility, enabling them to keep up with the latest technology tools and utilize their investments fully. Their focus on finding feasible solutions for maximum value and high engagement with clients ensures the success of their solutions and the adoption of technology by users. By automating processes and utilizing AI and machine learning, companies can optimize their operations, making information workers more efficient, but not necessarily replacing jobs entirely.

<p>Hello, this is Darren</p>
<p>Pulsipher, chief solution,architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,where we investigate effective change,leveragingpeople process and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode,</p>
<p>Innovation is a service with Andrew Cohen,managing director of Netsurit.</p>
<p>Andrew, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>So is Andrew Cohen, former CEO of Evokeand now managing director of Netsurit.</p>
<p>So, Andrew, tell tell my audiencea little bit about yourselfand your backgroundand why you're talking to us today.</p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me on today.</p>
<p>Just probably going backto how you introduced me.</p>
<p>You know, I'm actually a former North</p>
<p>Carolinian, moved to New York backin 97, I believe,and I started a company called Evoke.</p>
<p>We really focused on,you know, technology design back then.</p>
<p>And then over the years, we evolvedinto really a digital transformationcompany, really focusing on helpingcompanies create modern workplaces and,you know, just accelerateuser engagement and employee engagementon our kind of projects we work on.</p>
<p>And recently, at the end of 2021,we were approached probably a littlebefore the end of 2012, right after COVIDfrom a company called Net.</p>
<p>Surratt</p>
<p>That's the company I'm part of now.</p>
<p>We were acquired,and they're a global MSP,one of the largest MSPsthere have operations in the U.S.and in South Africa and now in Poland.</p>
<p>So wethey formed like the traditional MSP modeland which is, you know, managedservices, I.T., cybersecurity,all the good infrastructure stuff,which we call foundation work.</p>
<p>They wanted us to fitinto a particular niche, what we callnet cert automate,which is the innovation team at NetSuite.</p>
<p>So I had that up on the managing directorof that net Cert automate group,and we really focused on innovationand creating automation.</p>
<p>Special kind of situationshelp companies acceleratebetter processes, improvementsin terms of how they do their daily jobs.</p>
<p>So it's been a really interestinglast year</p>
<p>I've been part of it for a year nowand exciting and looking forward towhat the future is going to bring.</p>
<p>So this is really you know,</p>
<p>I remember when we first talked,</p>
<p>I was like intriguedthat it's innovation as a service.</p>
<p>I because my brain first goeswhere you can't you can't packageinnovationinto a little bundle that you sell.</p>
<p>And then when you started talking to meabout it, I went, Huh?</p>
<p>I like I likeyour approach is very interesting.</p>
<p>Oh, this innovation as a service concept.</p>
<p>I tell to our audiencea little bit about what that meanswhen you say innovation as a service.</p>
<p>First thing that comesto my mind is Thomas Edisongot. Well, that would be greatif you were that level.</p>
<p>Yes, but but you guys actuallydo some things that kind of helpwith the whole innovation processand a free peopleto do more innovativethings than redundant work.</p>
<p>Yeah, terrific.</p>
<p>No, that's a thank you for that.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of howwe define innovation as a service, it'swhat we callperpetual innovation, perpetual agility.</p>
<p>So we believe that, like you just said,you can't bottled upinnovation is not a final destination,especially with all the changesin business,how people are doing business from,you know, hybrid workforces now to peoplebeing forced to come back to work.</p>
<p>There's all these opportunities to createbetter process efficiencies, businessefficiencies,to make them better employee experiences.</p>
<p>And then in terms of how we do itas a service is a mostly ongoingtype of opportunity where we find areasthat are really challengesfrom an organization,from whether it's manual,repetitive process, disparate systemsthat don't speak to each other,disparate workforces that are havinga hard time communicating, collaborating.</p>
<p>We look at how we stitch all that togetherfrom the operational effectfrom this point of viewand deliver solutionsin terms of things that they can leveragetheir technology investment.</p>
<p>We help implement the solutions.</p>
<p>And on top of that, and then in parallel,we're alsolooking at opportunities to helpfor outreach to customer experiences.</p>
<p>So it's really kind of an understanding ofthat full loop of how we have engagementfrom internal and external audiencesand then how we can build solutions thatthat live in their own world,which you call their tenancy and they own.</p>
<p>We just help them execute on those.</p>
<p>So when I heard this,</p>
<p>I thought, this sounds a lot likeprocess re-engineering process automation,where you guys can actually come inand help an organization,look at their processes, find outbetter ways to optimize their processesand automate at the same time.</p>
<p>Am I hearing that right?</p>
<p>And it starts really with conversationslike this.</p>
<p>And essentially the initial callwhen I meet with a new companyas a company was already working with,we try to identify sort of those initialpain points as use cases that exist.</p>
<p>What you're saying is processesthat are manual.</p>
<p>There's a lot of lift,there's a lot of spreadsheetsfrom all different areasfeeding into one master giant spreadsheet.</p>
<p>So we love hearing thatbecause then we can look at the areasof opportunity to say,how do we find the maximum value,which is the most feasible solutionthat can be done in a very low codeor low code type of implementation to findthe biggest impact on the business?</p>
<p>So that's exactly right.</p>
<p>We're looking at this processimprovements. It's not always automation.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's better collaboration,it's better uses of the tools.</p>
<p>They already have a better useradoption of the technology they have.</p>
<p>We can help companies understandwhat they can do without even our helpto implement from ano code type of solution profile as well.</p>
<p>So it's always kind of a high engagementmodel and we really have to get immersedwith the companies we work with in small,many business enterprise,and then we're looking at those use casesand then charting those prioritize,and that's voting on those togetherwith the stakeholders internally, etc..</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of work.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Well, now for the clients we are it'sa big uplift from the from our point is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well that's where the value comesin, right.</p>
<p>You're like,what's the best way to put it?</p>
<p>You're like a third party agnostic.</p>
<p>You're coming in and saying, Hey, well,the culture that you've builtaround these processes,because that's really what happens, right?</p>
<p>Some of them are ad hoc processes andand you can show them a small changehere, can unleash all of thisspeed and and and innovationand things like that.</p>
<p>Is thatthat's exactlyand I think it's something that we docome in as there is potentiallytheir digital innovation team.</p>
<p>And that's why we kind of doas an ongoing service.</p>
<p>And you really hit it right therein terms of we talk to companies that arewanting to scale.</p>
<p>They're very innovative.</p>
<p>We call them the Jackrabbits.</p>
<p>You know, they can do all these things.</p>
<p>They keep buying</p>
<p>SAS solutions that fit a need,and then they have all thesekind of thingsthat live in their ecosystemthat nothing communicates togetherand they never get past that next levelto scale properly.</p>
<p>And then the larger organizationand this is not just speakbadly about enterprise clients.</p>
<p>We love our enterprise clientsthat we classify as junkers in a wayjust because they're so big.</p>
<p>There's that it's not a problem of scale.</p>
<p>They have a problem of innovationbecause they have all those processesjust in place.</p>
<p>It's entrenched,people are scared of change.</p>
<p>They don't want to do a new processto maybe their fill outfear of the job lossbecause they might find an automationsolution.</p>
<p>We're not looking to replace people.</p>
<p>We're looking to help augment,make a better lifeexperience, a better job experience.</p>
<p>So then whatwe try to create within those two areas,from the Jackrabbits to the Junkers,is what we call the juggernauts.</p>
<p>That's the amalgam,the perfect kind of scenariowhere companies that can scaleand innovate at the same time.</p>
<p>And that's what we look atand how we can help the system as it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So to get someone in,can you move a jackrabbit to a juggernautand a junk or to a juggernaut,you can do that or.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it's it's something that's we findthat's how the innovation servicereally works.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it's targetingmore for the SMB market,you know, because,you know, we're doing innovationwork with enterprise clientsand I'll get to that on the junker side.</p>
<p>But on the jackrabbit side,certainly, yes.</p>
<p>Once we got to identify what they'recurrently working, their challenges are,we can helpcreate these digital implementationsthat are going to stitch togetherall this crazy stuffthey've already createdinternally as a scale.</p>
<p>They don't have the breakevery time they go from three peopleto ten people 10 to 20.</p>
<p>You know, there'sa thing called a mikitani rulewhere things break after 3 to 10 people.</p>
<p>So we look at wayswe can help them along that way, chartthat roadmap and together.</p>
<p>So when they introducethese new solutions, there's full useradoption, there's showing the uptick.</p>
<p>We're measuring the effectivenessof all these tools.</p>
<p>So the ROI is completely baked in.</p>
<p>We guarantee or I statementevery solution we build inand then we help them scaleas they're innovated.</p>
<p>Now the other side of the fence is,you know,the larger organizations,corporate companies, 1000 people, and upthere have the cap,they have the scale question figured out.</p>
<p>It's just the innovation thing.</p>
<p>So we help them with the creator.</p>
<p>We become that really Go-To teamwhere everything gets funneled intofor all the lines of business,into the center of Excellencefor Digital solutions,and then we start executing solutionsagainst that.</p>
<p>So it's an ongoing engagementon enterprise agreementwhere they funnel intheir needs from the line of business.</p>
<p>So H.R.might have one needbecause this big departmenthas financement have a little need,and then they all have potential thingsthat we can leverage from their technologyinvestment to, let's say it'sthe Microsoft stack,for example, for power, automate power by,you know, powerapps.</p>
<p>So we're looking at what they'vealready spent and how to fully maximizenext what they have instead, insteadof bringing in a bunch of new toolsand things like that, our guys are like,</p>
<p>All right, what do you have?</p>
<p>Maybe identify gaps?</p>
<p>Yeah, that gaps.</p>
<p>And we can also depreciateor retire solutions that are redundant.</p>
<p>So there might bemultiple tools in place that they purchasebecause it's the next greatest thing.</p>
<p>But then, you know,</p>
<p>Microsoft keeps investing heavilyand there's such a great roadmap and chartfor what's coming down the linewith Microsoft and all the cool thingsthat are happening.</p>
<p>We can look at what might be a like itemgap analysis.</p>
<p>Can we replace it?</p>
<p>Saving some costs on our licensingand especially the launch of the company?</p>
<p>That could be a pretty significant savingsthat they use fully their licensethey have and leverage that fullywith their Microsoft investment.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So so what do you think you guys coming inengage with these teams?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's the biggest barrierfor innovation in these companies?</p>
<p>Why can't they just do this themselves?</p>
<p>I mean, they have all the knowledgeof the systems.</p>
<p>They so so let's talk about the enterprisecustomer first, right?</p>
<p>The big guys, because it's differentwith a jackrabbit than it iswith with the junker, right.</p>
<p>So what's the biggest barrierfor them doing this themselves?</p>
<p>Why why have you come in?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I think what I found is in the enterpriseclients we work with,we're doing the solutions for there's athey have the investment in place.</p>
<p>They have the 5000 plus Microsoft licensesalready leveled out.</p>
<p>They have maybe using 20% of the capacitywork.</p>
<p>And do the teams that are in there,the massive i.t.</p>
<p>Infrastructure, their focus on whateverthey do from the systems they support,you know, in their environment.</p>
<p>So they're not really focusedon this kind of hyper automationtype of things that we come in and do.</p>
<p>So they're really it's not in focusfor them, even if they've identified thiscenter of excellenceto create this areas withall these automation or modernizationopportunities can happen.</p>
<p>They don't have the teamsto execute on it.</p>
<p>So that'swhere we kind of fall into it. Well.</p>
<p>So we partner well in that situation.</p>
<p>And again, they don't really have themaybe they havea great strategic teams and all that andactually they can't do that part of it.</p>
<p>But we live this.</p>
<p>I mean, this is all we do,you know, so that there it'll beit's like a secondary job.</p>
<p>They'd have to build their own teamand find the talent to be able to executeon these solutions on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>So and we're tied into that successalong the way as well.</p>
<p>So it's really kind of identifiedthe outsourcefor that particular portion of it.</p>
<p>And then we're just implementing with themand along the way it help themstay in line of mind.</p>
<p>So, so, so I heardthey may not have the skills to knowhow to re-engineer processesbecause that that's not somethingthat you're just born with.</p>
<p>That takes a lot of knowledge, right?</p>
<p>Will to do root cause and to do,you know, all, all, all that stuff.</p>
<p>I just got through taking a bunchof classes on process re-engineering, so.</p>
<p>Okay. Right, right.</p>
<p>So yeah, I, I know the book learning stuffand I've done some stuff too, but,but so skills is one thing,but I could build a teamif I have enough people.</p>
<p>You could. Absolutely.</p>
<p>But the budget will be good.</p>
<p>Build a team.</p>
<p>Yeah,but also is it also that you can bringin a new set of eyes without having anyany baggage, politics or baggage?</p>
<p>Right now we come inand we're looking at the problemand we're not looking at whowho created the problem.</p>
<p>It already exists.</p>
<p>You know, we know that problem existsand we're not trying to sayyou're doing something wrong.</p>
<p>We're just trying to help themidentify the stakeholdersand create these ambassadors internally.</p>
<p>They embrace it.</p>
<p>So it's really importantthat we've we really kind oflike I said, we create stars internally.</p>
<p>Like we said, these juggernauts,we're creating these internal juggernauts.</p>
<p>We're working with them to make their jobeasier and better.</p>
<p>And then when they release these thingsinto the field internally,or if it's an operational solution,the return on it and the measuringis so effective, it just just resonates.</p>
<p>And, you know, they're measuredby those kind of solutions as well.</p>
<p>So your success is win.</p>
<p>It's tell me if I'm wrong here, butit sounds like you're saying your successis whenyou can step away from itand you'veyou've stood up stars to handle it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Because you don't want to be therelong term, right?</p>
<p>You don't want to be there for yearsand years and years.</p>
<p>Well, I would say we dowant to be there for long termin terms of an ongoing relationship.</p>
<p>So it'skind of like an annual type of agreement.</p>
<p>So it's retained.</p>
<p>But our solutions, once we deliverto a particular line of business,they don't break.</p>
<p>You know, these are the kind of thingsthat are not really heavy coding.</p>
<p>This is more low code type of solutions.</p>
<p>So, yes, we'll releasesomething to a team, our team,and they'll run with itand they don't have toif there's something they have to fix orwhatever,that's a little bit more of a code work.</p>
<p>They probably have to come to usor hand it off internally.</p>
<p>So everything is handed over.</p>
<p>It's turnkey,but we're still engagedfor other opportunitiesbecause most corporationswe work with any size, there might be 15.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sure you have a punch list. Yeah.</p>
<p>So we're a23 years onany type of relationship.</p>
<p>Beyond that, who knowswhat's going to happen after three years?</p>
<p>You know, things keep changing.</p>
<p>Technology keeps improving every year.</p>
<p>So we're excitedto be there for a long engagements.</p>
<p>But these are not long term projects.</p>
<p>Maybe. That's right. Right. No, no.</p>
<p>You can deliver a solution.</p>
<p>I gotcha. But.</p>
<p>But you're also you'realso obviously doing training of people.</p>
<p>Yes. Right on the on the new solution,you probably have some champions,which you mentioned.</p>
<p>You call them stars for yourfor your juggernauts, which I like.</p>
<p>I like that a lot.</p>
<p>Have you seen that There's that newcommercial where everyone's a rock star.</p>
<p>It was that.</p>
<p>Yeah. That was hilarious.</p>
<p>That was a good one.</p>
<p>I was really funny and it's like it'san overused term, I think, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And but, but in essence,that's what you try and do with your newsolutions is youpick a couple evangelists, rock stars.</p>
<p>Hey, you're the rock starof this new automated process that,you know, if you use this, you'regoing to be so much more efficientand productive than anyone else.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>I mean,and it and it's also truecontextual kind of solutions.</p>
<p>You know, when we buildsomething is very specific.</p>
<p>What does that need? We're trying to fix?</p>
<p>And if you can show a personthey're going to save 100 hoursa month by not doing that task, that's youthat gets sent up in one.</p>
<p>It's massive, you know,and it's all sudden they can do somethingfor the other area of the businessthat they were not doing before.</p>
<p>So their job goes from manualkind of effort, churn, miserablelife experienceto a better employee experiencewith actually adding more valueto the business.</p>
<p>That's when we really identify success.</p>
<p>It makes me excitedwhen we see solutions like thatthat just change an employee's outlook onwhen they turn on the computer every dayand ask a tough question.</p>
<p>You canyou can say you don't want to answer it.</p>
<p>It is there it is.</p>
<p>How often do you run into the concernthat you guys are going to come inand replace people's jobsbecause you're automating awaywhat they do?</p>
<p>Is that happeningand how often do you see that?</p>
<p>I'll tell you this,</p>
<p>We we do have a scenario.</p>
<p>We're working with an enterprise company,and we got engaged initiallybecause during COVID,they got rid of a massive amountof the layoffs of about 250 to 500 people.</p>
<p>I think it was in that range.</p>
<p>And they said by automationand some of these thingsthat we're going to bring in,we won't have to rehire.</p>
<p>So we understandthat's a potential scenario.</p>
<p>So there's a real need to likewhen there's a downsizing,depending on the industry,that can these solutions help us not haveto replace talent and bookfull time employees back in the place.</p>
<p>Now, on the other side of that,when we build a solution,where does pretty much automateso much tasks daily?</p>
<p>The goal is, you know, we're not tryingto do that to replace a job.</p>
<p>It does come up and I'm</p>
<p>I can say it never will happen.</p>
<p>But really what I findand the companies we work with,they're trying to see how they canengage their workforce more effectivelybecause they know there's talent there.</p>
<p>And it might be some tilethat's not even tapped into fullybecause they're doing somethingthat's manual data entry all day longinstead of,you know, maybe I should be visualizinganalyzingthat data, reporting differently,or having more discussions aroundwhat that data means versus typing it in.</p>
<p>So if we can find waysto make that person's job change,</p>
<p>I'd be more than happy.</p>
<p>But sometimes, yeah, of course, someif it's an automated, likesomeone just pushing a button all daylong in a bar can do it.</p>
<p>You know, maybe that is somethingthat needs to be looked at and replaced.</p>
<p>Have you guysare you using anyartificial intelligenceor machine learning techniquesand or process or programsto help with the automation?</p>
<p>Or do you still see that's too far outstill where you guys sit withwith that prior to church CBTbeing so publicized now you knowand and how it's being implemented</p>
<p>Microsoft it's the being in the servicenow in teams that's still nascent.</p>
<p>We're not really tappinginto other corporations to work with yet.</p>
<p>Prior to that, there's big things going on</p>
<p>Cognitive services, machine learning</p>
<p>API we were doing with Azure,so there was opportunityfor some of the projectswe built out of these knowledge basesand curated massive libraries of contentand, you know,index all that libraries of contentby using AI and cognitive services.</p>
<p>So it automatically populateall this kind of information with themodels we build.</p>
<p>And then it would read all that contentin terms of calling blocksand chunks of content.</p>
<p>So it index all the final,the many words and keywords.</p>
<p>And so we build these lowend solutions, what we call knowledgebases are smart libraries,where instead of someone having to go into endure all that metadataand so is be highly searchableand friendly,the way I already done that, completedthat task for that person.</p>
<p>So thousands of man hours were savedby just tapping and A.I.and cognitive servicesand now a chat CBT withsome of the companies we're working with,they are like the high level</p>
<p>E5 licenses and teams is going totake a team of essentials</p>
<p>I think is going to allow itto be utilizedin their more meaningful meetings.</p>
<p>We're just going to be ableto help companies enablebecause we're so ontop of this technology, we understandwhat's going to doand once we understand fullyhow it's going to be implemented,we're going to offer this kind of ideashow they can best utilize it.</p>
<p>Someone's going to be like out of the box.</p>
<p>They might not need us to implementanything.</p>
<p>Just tell themshape it right for their organization.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, so you actually see GPT or generative?</p>
<p>I like that as being somethingthat can actually really helpis what you're saying with automation orinformation workers getting their workdone more, finding informationand that for sureand the cognitive services</p>
<p>I talked about before,that's really building the modelsand building solutionsthat can help deliver kind of resultsthat are unique for that particular fit.</p>
<p>The changes,how I see and really involveonce we understand how the air is going tothe API is going to be allowedto be utilized internally becauseremember this really kind of feelingheavy external within.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. So change in I'm fine with it.</p>
<p>Just askingto do all kinds of crazy thingswhere we used to stay up all nightplaying with it.</p>
<p>But I'm also seeinghow it can be implementedand utilized by our technology teamsto maybe be more efficient,whether it's document writing, code ideas,you know, just have them understandhow to develop more quickly.</p>
<p>It won't replace our engineers,but it will help augment and acceleratemaybe things.</p>
<p>So what we're saying,there's innovation and service.</p>
<p>We might be able do more in less time nowjust because we can leveragewhat's going on this whole I gotcha.</p>
<p>In fact, I actually interview</p>
<p>Chat Gupta on the podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, terrific.</p>
<p>A couple.</p>
<p>And I asked it a similar questionthat I asked you.</p>
<p>What can and of course, itsaid, Oh, I can do all that stuff.</p>
<p>No big deal, right?</p>
<p>But I still need a human to promise meis what it said,which I thought was hilarious.</p>
<p>I told one of my colleagues,</p>
<p>I was like, we were chatting on TVjust ahe was on Chatty Betty and I was as well.</p>
<p>We're just playing around,come up with ideasjust to see what we could testthe engine at.</p>
<p>And I said, You know what?</p>
<p>I feel I'm humbledand I feel really stupid right now.</p>
<p>This thing is better than I am, issmarter, is faster,and it's like, I'm never going to compete.</p>
<p>You know, as quick as they can do it.</p>
<p>So I said,</p>
<p>I better have a good personalitybecause I think I could win the.</p>
<p>Oh, that's that's hilarious. Whatcan you give me an example ofmaybe an engagement you had that failedand why it failed?</p>
<p>Do you have any you have any examples?</p>
<p>You don't don't be don't be specific,but just tell me, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know,we we find what we even have a whole likewhen I do my kind of things,</p>
<p>I do my TEDx talk type of presentations.</p>
<p>You know, I'm on TEDx talk.</p>
<p>I'm the same way I do like those typeof podcasts and things of that nature.</p>
<p>One of the things I do iswhy digital transformation fails,and these are solutions we built as well.</p>
<p>We come up with the greatest idea.</p>
<p>We think it's going to work well,but we find out the adoption is really lowonce it's releasedand some things happen,their budgets not fully executed again,some other considerations or managementhasn't fully pushed out theyou know, this as a real digitaltransformation for the company.</p>
<p>So it's kind of stalled.</p>
<p>And like again,that's why we create this whole thingof perpetual agility,perpetual innovation,because these solutions can stall,they can get released,but then what's next?</p>
<p>So there's like the thingsthat get a lot of pomp and circumstancearound the release of a solution.</p>
<p>And then if there's not awhat's the next thingto keep people engagedand to come back for what we're doingif it doesn't really change the behavior,that's where these things have failed.</p>
<p>So that's whywe kind of created this whole way.</p>
<p>We do it now much more effectivelybecause we're really identifyingthat business case problem.</p>
<p>It has to fix the problem.</p>
<p>It has to show in our why.</p>
<p>Otherwise there's no reason even do it.</p>
<p>And then we're measured completely on thator an hour on a contract.</p>
<p>So if our solutions do not hit and what wesay it's going to do, we're not going toyou know, we have to keep workingfor several more monthstill it gets right.</p>
<p>So it's very a unique engagementout of that one.</p>
<p>And it helps mitigate in that problemwith delivering solutionsthat won't, you know, be adoptedbecause they're going to have to be so.</p>
<p>So you're not just building something,even collecting requirementsand then building somethingand throwing it over the wall.</p>
<p>You guys go through the full deployment,not just deployment,but adoption cycle too, right?</p>
<p>So you're like going,we've got to get the ROI out of this.</p>
<p>I kind of like that approach becausethere's skin in the game for you guys,you know, completely.</p>
<p>We call the ROI guarantee returnan innovation guarantee,but it's really an R y guarantee. Yeah.</p>
<p>And it's measured upfront with the client.</p>
<p>So we do this workshopsor ideation sessions with our clientsor customers, and we identifyall the pain points we have.</p>
<p>We chart those measure and what the real,you know,time waste, whatever the measurement is,we're going to find it outand then calculate it very effectivelyand get agreement before we build.</p>
<p>Is this effective?</p>
<p>Is this what we want to measure?</p>
<p>Is this the best thing,the most prioritize solution?</p>
<p>And then we work against that.</p>
<p>And when we release it, then we doour weekly meetings for like delivery.</p>
<p>But then once we get to post delivery,the monthly kind of sessions, chartingis the solution really being effective?</p>
<p>We said it was going to be.</p>
<p>We knew that and then we all agreedon the hypothesis of Here'swhat we're going to build.</p>
<p>They accepted the ROI.</p>
<p>That's what we've challenged with.</p>
<p>Our solutionhas to deliver on that, right?</p>
<p>So yes, we have skin of that gameall the way along and it's over.</p>
<p>That was our releases completed.</p>
<p>So over the next 12 months of chartingagainst that to hit that floor of wow.</p>
<p>So much.</p>
<p>That's a very different model than what</p>
<p>I've seen other people do, which is,</p>
<p>Hey, I built it. It meets your specs.</p>
<p>Yeah, done Right.</p>
<p>We used to do that, too.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn't like I was.</p>
<p>We always, like, want to be thereif needed, But you build a solution,deliver it, and you're done.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah. Come back to need it.</p>
<p>And we always want to stay engaged,but this keeps us a little bit more.</p>
<p>Obviously, like yousaid, skin in the game, more involved.</p>
<p>You know, my, you know,my is all over this.</p>
<p>It has to work.</p>
<p>You know, if my reputation is on it.</p>
<p>So if we don't deliver, it's really bad,you know, for mepersonally, professionally.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that we promisesomethingthat's something that's achievable.</p>
<p>And it's going to hitthe mark of the expectations.</p>
<p>And then ongoing after year one,it keeps earning for that companybecause they're not to pay for it again,they own that solution.</p>
<p>They are like keeps going up.</p>
<p>Year two, it makes even more becausewe're not touching it again typically.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, typically. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>All right. So.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So we went on. All right, Barriers.</p>
<p>Tell me your biggest success,</p>
<p>Little effort,biggest visit, biggest ROI,where it was like, wow, all they had to dowas flip the switch and boom, everything,</p>
<p>Everything started working.</p>
<p>Have you run anything like that? Yes.</p>
<p>You know, it's not even alarge solution, butand I've been saying this use caseno more recently than youbecause it was a more recent one.</p>
<p>I guess for a large enterprisewe work with.</p>
<p>And it just was so successfulbecause it was such a simple ideaand it was really goes to an employee'sexperience and also field engagement.</p>
<p>So this company had about 5000 fieldsalesforce out in the fieldand at the point of salethey were having a supply chain issuesbecause of post COVIDand all the supply chain issues.</p>
<p>So fulfillment of ofwhen things are going to get tothe designation issue where they're at,the client, they didn't have information.</p>
<p>So it would be they'd sent an email to onecentralized inboxand within 24 to 48 hoursthey might they get the response back.</p>
<p>And the reason why I was taken so long isbecause we had one or two individualsat the home Office doing essentiallyemail triage, hundreds of emailsflooding this email box.</p>
<p>And what happens that personand not only hasa look at the email respond,but also go to the otherfulfillment applicationsthey had to see what's really the reason.</p>
<p>And that took time.</p>
<p>So that'swhy it's a 24 to 48 hours at best.</p>
<p>So we looked at ways how do we automate,how do we simplify this?</p>
<p>So for what we did for the we created,all the field is on iPhones,you know, devices.</p>
<p>So they were able to use a little quicknative app, which sent a formatted emailinto that same centralized email inbox.</p>
<p>But instead of a personseeing that we had an automated response.</p>
<p>So you were checking in parallel,that response is going directlyto the fulfillment application.</p>
<p>So it was touch in a third party systemsto see where the supply chain issue was.</p>
<p>And if it's in Albuquerqueand it's going to be there tomorrow,at least had an answerfor that right now. Andthis is all happened in real time.</p>
<p>So we went from 24 to 48 hoursto get a response to that personwhen he's rightat the point of sale to 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
<p>So I just love this storybecause it's so highly engaged.</p>
<p>It just works so seamlessly.</p>
<p>And it was a reallycould be built in like four weeks.</p>
<p>And the other thing that we had fromthe would rememberwe talked about the employeewhere they could do morefor their coverage of losing their joband then they like answering emails.</p>
<p>Well, now they're only having engagedwhen there's a real needso they can look at the dashboard,really visualize the information.</p>
<p>So when they have to step inand be manual to that process,there's a whole thing in the work streamthat we say, Here's we look at it,look at the dashboard we created.</p>
<p>Here's the reason If there's a real supplychain issue is not going to be there,then they have to have some livecommunication,but really mitigated a lot of that.</p>
<p>So that email churn is completely gone.</p>
<p>So that's pretty cool.</p>
<p>And I like how you mentioned those workersare now looking beyond triage.</p>
<p>They're not doing triage anymore.</p>
<p>No more. Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is, which is awesome.</p>
<p>That frees them up to be more innovative,</p>
<p>That frees them upto do more valuable work.</p>
<p>And I think that rightthere is is where we needto get to, especially inand I talk a lot about supplychains, secure supply chain,especially when we have to start competingwith the world in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, right.</p>
<p>And in and in other things,any process automation that we have bothin the back office and in the factoryis going to be invaluableto keep upwith withwhat's going on in the world today.</p>
<p>And we're going to have tothat's just a fact.</p>
<p>You know, I also have another case.</p>
<p>I just what I like it when some of oursolutions have unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah. It kind ofwe built it for this reason.</p>
<p>And as a manufacturing clientand medical device manufacturer,they're growing or acquiring companies,but they built a thingto fix the dashboards they had.</p>
<p>You know, there's all inventory managementand at the location, but the unattendedoutcomes for what it did on top of thatfor the sales side of the businessand understanding when they could getthe fulfillment done much quicker.</p>
<p>And it was changing the whole salesmethodologyjust by a solution they built thatdidn't even have that as initial need.</p>
<p>It just had extension.</p>
<p>And, and I wish I would have visualizedall those ideas for them,but it was greatthat he gave me that feedback.</p>
<p>They askedif we're cool because that makes it.</p>
<p>I get a little bit more feedback that way.</p>
<p>Then I can look at the next solution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you thought about it?</p>
<p>How it chartsacross the rest of the business,not just fixingthat particular area of the business.</p>
<p>So that's a reallywe want to do in that type of engagement.</p>
<p>Hey, that's, that's awesome.</p>
<p>When you get that secondary benefitand even tertiary or right.</p>
<p>Other processes changebecause you automated another process.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Hey Andrew, it's been wonderfultalking to you today.</p>
<p>Innovate.</p>
<p>I never thought innovation is service,but you proved it.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
<p>So we're doing it.</p>
<p>We're proving it every day. So I hope.</p>
<p>Well, hey, thanks again,</p>
