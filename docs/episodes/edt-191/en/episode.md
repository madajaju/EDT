## The Integral Role of Leadership

Adapting to digital transformation requires strong leadership and complete buy-in from the C-suite. Leilani draws from her experience transitioning from a traditional marketing project manager to a digital-focused role. Essentially, it's about applying traditional management skills—tracking timelines, assigning roles, overseeing deliverables—but with an added focus on how technology impacts the organization's workings, which she terms as a crucial facet of digital project management.

The early buy-in of leaders is invaluable because they shape the technology's role and potential future uses within the organization. By actively participating in the adoption process, they provide a reassuring presence to the team members and help cultivate a culture of technological adaptability within the organization. Just

## Going Beyond Tools

Digital transformation extends beyond integrating advanced tools into the workplace. Indeed, for Leilani, it also involves meeting customers where they are and providing them with a personalized experience. Successfully marrying people skills with technology goes a long way in helping companies adapt to change and grow seamlessly.

The most significant hurdle to this change is the company's success, which makes them question the need to alter established procedures and systems. However, companies that proactively invest in transformation during their successful phases tend to stay ahead in the increasingly competitive market.

## Anticipating Change – A Constant in Business

The critical takeaway from Leilani's discourse is that digital transformation is not merely about adopting innovative technologies. Instead, it is about successfully integrating people, processes, and technology. To keep up with the rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses need to foster a culture that embraces change and prioritizes clear communication.

Leilani's experience-rich insight sheds light on how companies can anticipate change as a constant in business. For businesses to thrive amidst constant transformation, they must value flexibility, strong leadership, and strategic planning. These factors, coupled with a focus on operational efficiency and customer engagement, would help them navigate the digital journey successfully.
