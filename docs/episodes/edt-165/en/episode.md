## Understanding Compute Options

Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer a mix of different compute families, ranging from older generations of compute hardware to the latest and more performant instances. These older generations are often used for cost-effective computing functions, while newer generations offer improved performance at similar or lower prices.

It can be overwhelming to navigate through the numerous computing options available in the cloud, especially with new instances being regularly released. That's where cloud specialists, such as those at Intel, come in. These experts can provide valuable insights and assist in selecting the most suitable instance for a specific workload.

## Making Informed Decisions

To make the best decision, seek the advice of cloud specialists or use tools like Densify or Intel Site Optimizer. These tools leverage machine learning to analyze an application's features, compute usage, and network needs to determine the most suitable instance size. By leveraging these resources, organizations can ensure they're getting the most out of their cloud resources, avoiding underutilization or overspending.

## Implementing Best Practices

It is important to incorporate instance recommendations into infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, such as TerraForm, to automate the selection of the most performant instance for a workload. This ensures consistent and efficient instance placement, removing the risk of human error and optimizing performance.

## Considering Portability

While Intel currently dominates the cloud market with x86-based instances, there is some competition from AMD and ARM. ARM-based processors, such as the Graviton, are popular among CSPs but need more workload portability between providers and between public and private environments. Porting x86-based workloads to ARM would require extensive code refactoring and redevelopment.

Organizations should consider compatibility issues when repatriating workloads from the cloud back to on-premises infrastructure. It's crucial to assess the portability and flexibility of the chosen computing platform to ensure seamless transitions and avoid vendor lock-in.

## Conclusion

Selecting the right cloud instance is a critical decision that can impact your workload's performance, cost, and portability. With the aid of cloud specialists and tools, organizations can make informed decisions and optimize their cloud resource utilization. By understanding the available computing options, incorporating best practices, and considering portability, businesses can harness the full potential of the cloud while ensuring flexibility and efficiency in their operations.
