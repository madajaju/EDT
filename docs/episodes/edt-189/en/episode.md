This episode delicately examines this rapidly advancing field, shedding light on its profound influence on our lives. Amid their discourse, two main areas were markedly central - the evolution of HPC, presenting its potential efficiencies and challenges, and the company Parallel Works, born out of a profound need to democratize industry-specific workloads using high-performance computing models.

## The Evolution of High-Performance Computing

In the last ten years, high-performance computing (HPC) has undergone a significant transformation. Shaxted highlights that current technology allows us to fit almost five times more cores on a single chip than we could a decade ago. Each core represents a distinct processing unit capable of functioning independently of the other cores. This results in a significant surge in performance power, providing an affordable and efficient execution methodology that was previously only possible through high-cost supercomputing.

Although there have been significant advancements in the field of high-performance computing (HPC), setting up and configuring advanced HPC clusters is still an extremely difficult task. The challenge is not only limited to the hardware aspect, but it also includes the complex process of task setup. This requires a detailed knowledge of parallel computing, which adds to the steep learning curve.

## Democratizing HPC with Parallel Works

Shaxted and his co-founder, Mike Wild, had a vision to revolutionize the High-Performance Computing (HPC) industry, and they set out to achieve it by creating Parallel Works. The idea behind Parallel Works was to democratize industry-specific workloads and make them accessible on a commercial scale. The primary objective of Parallel Works was to simplify the HPC process and make it more user-friendly. 

This initiative aims to simplify the computational complexities of High-Performance Computing (HPC) for professionals in different industries. Its goal is to make this technology and its numerous advantages accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their computing background. By doing so, it will significantly reduce the learning curve and make it easier for more people to benefit from HPC.

## The Future of HPC

After the conversation between Shaxted and Pulsipher concluded, it was clear that HPC (High-Performance Computing) has a bright future ahead. HPC can significantly improve computational speed, provide access to advanced technologies and support the development of innovative solutions in machine learning and AI.

Echoing this thought, Shaxted acknowledges the ever-evolving role of HPC and its potential to drive innovation. It remains a crucial component for pioneering solutions, paving the way towards a more efficient and intelligent future.

Businesses and industries can benefit greatly from the integration of high-performance computing, as they ride the wave of digital transformation. This approach is considered the way forward by Pulsipher and Shaxted, as it provides the necessary computational boost to data-intensive industries, and also democratizes access for all.
