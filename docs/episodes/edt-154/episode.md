Generative AI is a transformative technology that can augment human creativity, enhance collaboration, and unlock new possibilities for work and communication. By leveraging AI's capabilities, individuals can generate content, summarize emails, and automate routine tasks, while maintaining human touch and individuality.

## Unleashing Human Creativity

### Understanding the Data Landscape and Setting Clear Goals

Dr. Lancaster emphasizes the importance of understanding the type of data you want to either use or create before delving into generative AI. Whether it's text, images, music, videos, or audio, having a clear understanding of your input and desired output enables you to select the most appropriate tools and platforms.

### Augmenting Human Creativity with AI

One of the key takeaways from the podcast is the role of generative AI in augmenting human creativity rather than replacing it. AI tools act as catalysts, enhancing and propelling human creativity to new heights. By combining the innovative mindset of humans with the capabilities of AI, individuals can solve complex problems and generate groundbreaking ideas that traditional approaches alone cannot achieve.

### Collaboration and Brainstorming with AI

Generative AI opens doors to collaboration and brainstorming. AI can serve as an additional voice in group discussions, sparking new perspectives and prompting fruitful conversations. This collaborative aspect is particularly valuable in group settings, where AI can listen to conversations, facilitate discussions, and help consolidate ideas into a consensus.

### Unleashing the Power of Generative AI

Generative AI holds immense potential to unlock creativity, augment human capabilities, and offer fresh perspectives and solutions to challenges. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or simply curious about AI, there is a wealth of opportunities to explore and create with generative AI.

## Practical Applications of Generative AI in the Workplace

In addition to the insights shared in the podcast, there are numerous practical applications of generative AI that can revolutionize our work processes. Let's explore a few of them:

### Summarizing Lengthy Emails and Streamlining Communication

Busy professionals often receive lengthy emails that consume valuable time. Generative AI can help by analyzing the email content and generating a concise summary that captures the main points and key takeaways. This allows recipients to grasp important information quickly and make informed decisions without spending excessive time reading through the entire email.

### Automating Content Creation

Generative AI can automate the creation of reports, articles, and other written content. By inputting relevant data or information into a generative AI tool, journalists and content creators can generate complete articles or reports based on that input. This saves significant time and resources, especially for those who need to produce large amounts of content regularly.

### Enhancing Artistic Creativity

Creatives in art and music can leverage generative AI to explore new styles, techniques, and inspirations. AI can assist artists in generating ideas, composing music, and creating visual content. With the power of generative AI, artists can expand their creative horizons and push boundaries in their respective fields.

## Balancing Automation and Human Touch

While generative AI offers incredible potential, it is crucial to maintain human oversight and intervention to ensure accuracy, context, and preserve individuality. Trusting AI-generated content blindly without human intervention can lead to homogenization in the digital landscape. It's essential to strike a balance between automation and the human touch, where AI enhances human creativity rather than replacing it.

As generative AI continues to evolve, we can expect to witness its integration into various aspects of work and communication. From summarizing emails to automating content creation and enabling new forms of artistic expression, generative AI has the capacity to streamline processes, enhance productivity, and unlock new possibilities for innovation. Embracing this technology, while upholding human creativity and uniqueness, will shape the future of work in remarkable ways.

<p>ï»¿1</p>
<p>Hello, this is Darren</p>
<p>Pulsifer, chief solution,architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,where we investigate effective change,leveragingpeople process and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode, exploringgenerativeair use cases with returning guest Dr.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Lancaster.</p>
<p>Geoffrey, welcome back to the show.</p>
<p>A third time's a charm. Thanks very much.</p>
<p>Appreciate it.</p>
<p>Hey, we had so much fun talkingand we've been talking a lot.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say theoretical, but not brass,not brass tacks, not day to day use.</p>
<p>And what can I do today?</p>
<p>Let's talk about that. Let's get into.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I got a GPT account.</p>
<p>I got a cloud to account.</p>
<p>I've got a with Bard accountand some other ancillary ones too.</p>
<p>I may go into playground</p>
<p>API to go generate images or whatever.</p>
<p>There's a lot out there. Yeah.</p>
<p>So what do I do with it all?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Where do you wanna start?</p>
<p>I Yeah, I brought that up.</p>
<p>Where do you want to?</p>
<p>The world is, like, wayopen for anything now.</p>
<p>Right. So when. When.</p>
<p>Whenever I talk to people about</p>
<p>Where do you want to start? Right.</p>
<p>The question that I start with iswhat type of dataare you trying to either useand what type of dataare you trying to create?</p>
<p>So, for instance,you want to start with texting.</p>
<p>Go to image.</p>
<p>You can start with text and go to text.</p>
<p>Do you want to start with textand go to music?</p>
<p>You start with musicand go to image. Do you?</p>
<p>What is your inputand what is your output?</p>
<p>And I think if you can pin those twothings down, depending on a given use caseand then we're going to talk throughdifferent usecases, is going to arrange different toolsthat people are going to use.</p>
<p>So you mentioned a couple.</p>
<p>You mentioned Chatty Beauty,you mentioned Bard,and those are both really goingto be text in, text out.</p>
<p>Something like Mid Journey is going to be,let's say text in, image out.</p>
<p>You know, there's going to be variationson that and on dailyand on stable diffusionwhere you can do image in, image out.</p>
<p>There are tools that you can doimage in video out.</p>
<p>There are ways that you can doaudio in, audio out,audio in, text out, text in, audio out.</p>
<p>And so you know where to keep uskind of from boiling the ocean about waysthat people can use this.</p>
<p>Let's start by just admittingthere's a little bit of creativitythat has to go into this.</p>
<p>It's not just, oh, I saw this thing.</p>
<p>I want to do that exactly now.</p>
<p>But the creativity is aroundwhat what am I working withand then what am I trying to accomplish?</p>
<p>And based on that, I'm going to selecta set of tools that gets me there.</p>
<p>Okay. So what you just saidis really interesting.</p>
<p>I want I want to key in on creativity.</p>
<p>So these are all your what is it?</p>
<p>Right brained or creative or left Ranger</p>
<p>Creative.</p>
<p>Refereeing or creative leftbrain? Your analytical.</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>All those analytical peopleare going to be left in the dustif they can't be a little bitcreative, right?</p>
<p>I mean, because like you said,there's so many opportunities,so many possibilities.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've already started playing around.</p>
<p>So the more creative you are,you can really do some amazing things inin creating things.</p>
<p>So is it safe to say that these A.I.generative A.I.is create is unleashing creativity?</p>
<p>And you and I talked a little bitabout that previously,that what the human brings to itin many ways is that creative component,which maybe that creativityis about asking the right question.</p>
<p>Maybe that creativity is about stitchingtools together in a way that the toolsthemselves aren't meant to be usedkind of packing things together.</p>
<p>Maybe the creativity is coming fromthis scenario or the use casethat you're actually trying to solve for.</p>
<p>So yeah, I do think there's creativityto it.</p>
<p>On the right handside of things,but there's also your left brain,like you actually have to be ableto implement that.</p>
<p>And so do you have people who can do that?</p>
<p>Do you have partnersthat you can work with to do that?</p>
<p>Do you want to try and do it yourselfand likereally get under the hood and figure outhow do the pieces all fit together?</p>
<p>And maybe you want to code it yourself.</p>
<p>All of those are possibilities.</p>
<p>And I know, you know,we want to kind of get to specifics,but I think it's worth starting therejust to recognize that the specificsthat we're going to talk aboutare not the only options.</p>
<p>There's people doing amazing,amazing things with these toolsbecause they're bringingthat creative mindset to it.</p>
<p>They're bringing a problem to itthat they can't solve with Google,that they can't solvewith sort of traditional search.</p>
<p>And by Google,</p>
<p>I mean like Google searchingthat they can't solve withmaybe a traditional analytical approach.</p>
<p>So all of these other toolsin their toolkit aren't going to work.</p>
<p>And so they get to a point wherethey say, you know what,</p>
<p>I need somethingthat's going to produce something new.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>I need to use Jeremy AI for that.</p>
<p>Okay, So this reminds me a little bit ofin the nineties about I learned aboutbrainstorming ideas and things like thatin group settings and things.</p>
<p>And so I've already done this.</p>
<p>I can brainstorm with an AI now.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>It gives me a second opinion. Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean it's the whole opinion,but it gives me a second opinionand then my brain went into weird placeslike couldn't I do groupand have an AI in my groupbrainstorming session?</p>
<p>Sure, kind of, because part of the hardestpart of brainstormingis coalescingand bringing everything together.</p>
<p>What a great opportunity for an AIto listen to a conversationbetween a group of people brainstormingand prompting and moving,moving them into having a consensus andand coalescing an idea.</p>
<p>Well, and I'll I'll go you one further,which is instead of a second opinion,what if you're a I can give you a second,third, fourth, fifth and sixth opinion.</p>
<p>So I actually prompting that to say, okay,you know, as an analytical thinker,give me your opinionas a creative thinker,give me your opinion as a leader.</p>
<p>Give me your opinion as a customer.</p>
<p>Give me your opinion as a whatever personayou might actually have it generatemultiple perspectives for youthat's actually betterthan what just a single other personmight be able to do.</p>
<p>So you can augment your team of maybe fouror fivewith a team of of ten or 20through an AItaking on different personas.</p>
<p>I never thought of it,but you're right, and I can bea multiple personalities.</p>
<p>You can take on differentpersonalities and.</p>
<p>All at the same time too.</p>
<p>So what's good about it is and you setsomething up where you start to say,</p>
<p>For any prompt that I give you,</p>
<p>I want you to respond.</p>
<p>As you know, this kind of arraykaleidoscopeof different voices and arrange itinto a table or arrange an involvement.</p>
<p>Yes, you can do that now.</p>
<p>And so is that going to take place?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's our first big use case.</p>
<p>Brainstorm. What?</p>
<p>I never thought of ituntil we started talking.</p>
<p>What a great idea. Right.</p>
<p>I can use it to bounce ideas offof from different perspectives.</p>
<p>So great brainstorming tooland I appreciate that.</p>
<p>It's a market research that branches outin synchrony development.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>Anythingyou might want to ask multiple, you know,productmarket set like market validation,things like that.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to usethat as kind of an early stageof your creative development process,your product development process,where you're essentially asking it.</p>
<p>You still might go and do thiswith humans later on, butyou know, giving you a direction,give you additional questions, giving youadditional feedback, that's a great placeto start with something real.</p>
<p>I think it's funny that you've called ushumans.</p>
<p>You're already talking like any AI.</p>
<p>Jeffrey I'm just I.</p>
<p>Talk about humans a lot and I think it'sa contrast to the technologiesthat we're talking about.</p>
<p>But I really believe,like you have to keep the humanat the core of the decisionsthat are making.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>If you invert thatand you put the technology at the core,</p>
<p>I think you're going to end up in a placethat you don't want to be.</p>
<p>You're going to end up solving problemsthat you don't need to solve.</p>
<p>Whereas if you keep the humanat the center of that decision making,then ultimately, hopefully you're doingsomething that somebody actually is great.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We got our first use case brainstorming.</p>
<p>Great. One, great one.</p>
<p>Next one, let's come up with another one.</p>
<p>What about generating contentspecifically in my day to day workemail, for example?</p>
<p>Email's a great one.</p>
<p>You know, being able to both writean email from scratch for youon a particular topic,being able to expand an email based onmaybe a shortened prompt,being able to shorten an emailif you're too verbose,being able to spell checkor change the voice of an email.</p>
<p>I think anybody who is particularabout their writing,you know, if somebody else goeswrites for you, maybe you want to convertthat over into your own, your own voice,just the way that you speak, the way thatyou write your own kind of written style,so you canfeed in your own styleinto these tools and say,given this new piece of writing, convertthat into being like my style.</p>
<p>So I've already noticed a little bitof that with a tool called Grammarly.</p>
<p>If people aren't using I've been using</p>
<p>Grammarly for about five or six yearsas I've been working on my my PhD.</p>
<p>It's been a life saverbecause I'm a horrible writer.</p>
<p>Graham Grammar, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm maybe I'mstill my freshman, an English teacher.</p>
<p>I got a D in that class and she said</p>
<p>I would amount to nothing on my last paperand I sent herthe first magazine coverthat I got the cover on that my article.</p>
<p>I sent that to heryearslater and said, Yeah, no, you're wrong.</p>
<p>But she didn't know I had a tech writerhelping me.</p>
<p>Well, I don't need a tech writer anymorebecause I have a tool like Grammarly.</p>
<p>That is,it learns my reading or my writing style.</p>
<p>It correctsmy grammar for me, has the right voice,and they recently added a AI to it.</p>
<p>But to augment or.</p>
<p>Talk about the content of that. Right.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>Anything on how you set up your AI?</p>
<p>The more technical writingmight still requiremore human intervention afterwards.</p>
<p>So we can't necessarilywe've talked a little bit about this.</p>
<p>You know, are you necessarily goingto trust the factual content?</p>
<p>So it might be in the styleof technical writing,but is it going to be accurateto the kind of situationthat the technical writingis being written for?</p>
<p>Maybe it will, maybe it won't.</p>
<p>And so that's where Ithink it's really important,really, for the human tostill intervene at some point,but to also come backand say, Did I get out of this toolwhat I wanted it to?</p>
<p>Because what you don't want to doingis writing an email to somebodythat mischaracterizessomething that misrepresentssomething that maybe says that you can dosomething that you can't do.</p>
<p>But it was part of the language modeland that then becamea component of that email.</p>
<p>So there's still, I think, an editingeditorial role for the human to play it.</p>
<p>I'm glad you brought that upbecause I think a lot of peopleare going to completely trust.</p>
<p>Yeah, give it an eyeand just send the email. Why?</p>
<p>A lot of the tools are smartenough today to say,</p>
<p>Are you sure you want to send this right?</p>
<p>It doesn't sayapproveeverything and send it says approve.</p>
<p>You can read it now and then send.</p>
<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>We do need to double checkbecause we can't fullytrust the content generated by this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there's going to be other things,you know, as you think aboutkind of that day to day work.</p>
<p>So whether it'sscheduling people,you know, that's a day to day taskthat actually can be really hardbecause maybe you're aligning schedules.</p>
<p>So doing something like thatand I can actually do really well.</p>
<p>I saw exampleswhere people were using thisto do kind of master schedulingfor courses for students in K-12,where, you know, the idea was, here'sall of the students,here's all of the classesthat they need to take now,arrange them intowhich class is going to be which period.</p>
<p>Our problem.</p>
<p>It's a hard problem for human to do,but for AI to take that data in aggregateand then to spit outthat kind of overall schedule.</p>
<p>Great problem for it to solve.</p>
<p>So logistics, I think, could be an areawhere people can look and start to say,you know, what?</p>
<p>Is there eithera more efficient way to do this?</p>
<p>Is there a way that maybe it just gets meto my starting point again,the human can go back and say, oh,we can't deliver from Peoria to Detroit.</p>
<p>I'd rather have them stop over here first,because the timing, you know,there might be things that as a human,you know.</p>
<p>That we're like the driver has lunchwith his wife.</p>
<p>Exactly. Or Yeah.</p>
<p>And it makes a happier employee.</p>
<p>So there's context that the</p>
<p>AI might not have, right?</p>
<p>That as humansthere's there's tacit knowledge,tribal knowledge that we havethat isn't written down anywhere.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>But that process, piece of it, you know,and there's another layer to process towhere there's still a lot of organizationsthat are having people fill out forms.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a paper form,maybe it's a an online form.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just you filling out a PDF,something like that.</p>
<p>But to extract the data out of PDFsis another area where you see AI doingreally, really well.</p>
<p>And what it doeswhen it does that, it's not doing one</p>
<p>PDF, it's doing all of your PDFs.</p>
<p>And so to take that and essentially builda knowledge base out of it,which you can then query, you canthen ask it questions.</p>
<p>So imaginebeing able to ask your documents questionsand having the AI respondin a way that that documentwould respond.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So so you brought up another,another interesting use case,which is it's a newespecially large language models.</p>
<p>It's a new interface.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Right.</p>
<p>Where it's more natural languagefor us to ask a question.</p>
<p>Because before, if I wanted to query,let's say it did read, itdid OCR and all my PDFs,it stored them all in databases, right?</p>
<p>In non structured databases,unstructured databases.</p>
<p>For meto write a query to get information outrequires me to understand the forms.</p>
<p>And relationships of ideas also.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But now I can I can explorethose forms in a more natural language waylike saying, Hey, you know,can you give me an idea ofall what's his medical cliniccan give me an idea of all of the menthat filled out the formover the last year that had skin cancer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that simple question like thatwhere before it would take,you know, some considerable amount of timefor data analysts to go and analyzeall the data and set up all the queries.</p>
<p>And then a simple queryof like select star where, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a natural for us. Right?</p>
<p>So that's what's the name forthat is really a conversational UI.</p>
<p>And so there's different typesof user interfaces.</p>
<p>This is a conversationwith the rotational UI.</p>
<p>There it is. Exactly.</p>
<p>And so you know, where that's coming intodifferent industriesis anywhere that you've needed to havea conversation, you know, think about techsupport, think about customer service,think about sales, think about</p>
<p>PCs, even making presentationslike communicating an idea,doing explainer videos,like all of those things where it'srequired somebody to essentially translatean idea into vernacular.</p>
<p>That's one area.</p>
<p>Or to say, okay,</p>
<p>I'm going to take your question,digest itwith all of the knowledge that I haveand then give you a product backor give you a, you know, address or.</p>
<p>Maybe ask you more questions.</p>
<p>Or maybe ask more questions. Right. Right.</p>
<p>Because what we've had in the pastis if I query a systemand I get let's say I get 100,000 hits,but I was onlyreally looking for maybe ten,then it may say,you know, I got a lot of informationback and Keydoes does color matter to you?</p>
<p>Does a color of hairthe color of their eyes matterof a why are you asking?</p>
<p>Well, because if you change itto color of eyes or Yeah,then I got a smaller datasetthat might be more relevant to you.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>To me, that's that's that unleashesmore information in a much fasterfor me to now make decisions on.</p>
<p>So I think that's where we're headed.</p>
<p>And it's really important to understandanother distinction of conversational</p>
<p>UI as well, which is there's somethinghappening behind the scenes when you usesome of these large language models,which is called dialog tracking.</p>
<p>So if you were to write a query, you writeyour SQL query or some other query,each time youdo it, you kind ofstill have to carry forward every other.</p>
<p>Text or Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, with dialog trackinginstead of having to say, okay, nowyou know, can you give me all of the oneswho have this and this and this and this?</p>
<p>You can just say, Well,what about ones that also have this?</p>
<p>And that also implies use everythingthat we've talked about, everything, learnand bring that to bear.</p>
<p>On my current questionand query or whatever.</p>
<p>And by doing that,that's the way that humans talk, right?</p>
<p>We don't say, you know, we don'taccumulate a conversation until we get to.</p>
<p>Query resistance to be really long.</p>
<p>And it's hard for usto keep all that in our brains.</p>
<p>But yeah, we bounce back and forth.</p>
<p>And so what the conversational UI doesin the dialog state tracking does members,what happens in that back and forthso that you know,the answer at the end can includeall those things you talked about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, great. All right. Let's, let's move.</p>
<p>Let's, let's shift.</p>
<p>Let's shift over to a generation.</p>
<p>And specifically,</p>
<p>I'm going to talk about business users.</p>
<p>Let's talkabout generating the presentationsbecause that's how we communicate.</p>
<p>Well, good or indifferent, whatever.</p>
<p>But let's talk about that firstand then we talkabout new modalities of communication.</p>
<p>We, a lot of uscreate PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'show we communicate in business, right?</p>
<p>And they even teach it in schoolnow, right?</p>
<p>The kids give a PowerPoint presentationon, you know, dinosaursor on the American Revolution,whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>I started seeing a little bit of thiswhere people are starting to usegeneral generative AIto produce PowerPointpresentations in a very interactive way.</p>
<p>Where I.</p>
<p>Had. Have you seen this as well?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you know, where I think this is goingand what you've seenfrom some of the tools is to builda presentation that does a certain thing.</p>
<p>So right now if I go to chat,</p>
<p>I can say, you know,give me the bullets of a presentationabout a particular topic and it'll go outand it'll pull all of that together.</p>
<p>Well, it'snot so unreasonable to, to take thatand then say, okay, for each of thosego out and get a relevant imageand a little bit of textand put that onto the slides.</p>
<p>So the automation of that kind ofbringing everything together is really,</p>
<p>I think, the kind of synthetic functionof generative AI.</p>
<p>And by synthetic I mean synthesis.</p>
<p>So what it's doingis it's taking a lot of disparate dataand trying to bring it togetherin a way that then can communicatethat idea effectivelywhere, you know,imaginebeing able to take a team's channelor a Slack channelor a a thread of some sortand say, take everything in this threadand synthesize itinto a few key points or a few key,maybe it slides or a few key,whatever medium that is,that's tremendousbecause now you've got legislatorswho can take a piece of legislationand synthesize it into a few keytalking pointsabout what it's actually about.</p>
<p>Anybody who's ever seen legislation,you know, it's usually a stack, buttechnical documentation synthesizethat technical documentationinto a few keypoints, synthesize anything that requirestremendous cognitive overhead, really,for a human to go through and digestand not just read it,but read it and make sense of it.</p>
<p>The AI, the generative, I can do thatmuch, much more efficiently than we can.</p>
<p>Okay, sothis reminds me of the term softwareengineers.</p>
<p>Yes, it took too long to read.</p>
<p>We didn't write.</p>
<p>TLDR Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. So.</p>
<p>So I can use generative</p>
<p>AI to take a really long email</p>
<p>I got from my boss.</p>
<p>Say I don't have 5 minutes to read this.</p>
<p>Drop it in there.</p>
<p>Give me the key point in my.</p>
<p>Suggested action items. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you can also say do this one.</p>
<p>Not this one, do this one, not this one.</p>
<p>And triggeranother series of events in thatin that chain.</p>
<p>Now, on the one hand, that's great,but the hope is that it's freeingyou up to do other thingswith that extra time that you're getting.</p>
<p>But I know that's a differentconversation, right?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>I was talking to my wife the other daywhen when I was a CIO, I had two admins.</p>
<p>I had a group admin for our IT departmentand I had a personal Adnan executivethat been that was the most productive</p>
<p>I've been in my whole life.</p>
<p>She was amazing.</p>
<p>I didn't read my emails.</p>
<p>I only read the emails that,that she you know, said</p>
<p>I we need a decisionfrom informational emails.</p>
<p>She would at the beginning of the dayand the end of the day.</p>
<p>I got a summary of of the key pointsthat I needed.</p>
<p>Right and and only important emailsflowed through to me.</p>
<p>My phone was monitored by by herand everything.</p>
<p>It was, it was wonderful.</p>
<p>I could focus on getting stuff doneinstead of all the interruptivethings that happened during the day.</p>
<p>And I was like, Man, I wish</p>
<p>I wish I had anexecutive assistantthat was an AI that was in that.</p>
<p>It's not there.</p>
<p>It's not there yetbecause it can't learn from me yet.</p>
<p>What I think is important, where mymy executive administrator every morningwe met, she knew what was important for methat day, what was stressing me out.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,we met as well and said, All right,this is what we got accomplished.</p>
<p>And it was it was it was wonderful.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying.</p>
<p>You still. Had that.</p>
<p>It it makes me wonderhow would I go about that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Stephen</p>
<p>Wolfram has a really interesting articlewhere he analyzed all of his emailover the last 20 years or so.</p>
<p>It's a great, great.</p>
<p>Would you. Say.</p>
<p>In analysis and data visualizationwhen he was emailing versuswhen he had his kids,you know, he was emailing laterat night and earlier in the morning.</p>
<p>And so really interestingkind of behavioral analysis of that.</p>
<p>But what I, I could imagineis a world in which you're givingsomebody access to your email archive,</p>
<p>It's determining for youwhat does this person find important?</p>
<p>What do they reply about what?</p>
<p>What's their style of replying?</p>
<p>When during the day do they replyto the point that you could startto build up some of the characteristicsthat you were saying about your ad?</p>
<p>Been?</p>
<p>Why couldn't you trainan item that you absolutely could do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, well,and then also I always look at my.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. I want to get better.</p>
<p>I'm not great.</p>
<p>I can always get better. Right?</p>
<p>So wouldn't it be greatif it could analyze and say,look,you're not great at responding to emails?</p>
<p>You sure? A lot better joband give me and give me tipsor you're not great at responding toto this or your answers are too short,which require multiple email exchanges.</p>
<p>So what could you do too?</p>
<p>There's so much roomfor improvement there.</p>
<p>So that's what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>That executive assistant I'm sure.</p>
<p>I'm sure some startups out theresay, Yeah, we got it.</p>
<p>And let me take.</p>
<p>Yeah, your point about something</p>
<p>I'm not good at and doing better at itand give you another use case,which is somethingthat a lot of people are not goodat is drawing.</p>
<p>So a lot of people are terribleat drawing.</p>
<p>You see draw they draw,you know, whatever it is, I am,you know, a little thing like thatwherethere's some really interestingdevelopments is around taking people'shand-drawn doodlesand converting that into a really slick,really well-produced graphic,which you could then use.</p>
<p>Maybe it's in your PowerPoint,maybe it's it's a marketing image,maybe it's some other way so thatthat human pieceis still starting things off,but you're then tapping into thiskind of tremendous graphical resourcethat then brings you back somethingthat's better than what you, you know,how long would it have taken you to buildthat in Photoshop plus Illustratorplus Unity, plus all these other tools?</p>
<p>Yeah, so long time.</p>
<p>I think in graphics there's certainlysome interesting things happen happening.</p>
<p>What Adobe's doing with Fireflyis very interesting with Generative Fill.</p>
<p>You know, I've seen a lot of these caseswheremaybe people are storyboarding an idea,they're storyboarding a commercial,they're storyboarding, you know,maybe a presentation or something elsecould be a movie or something.</p>
<p>And they kind of have an ideaof the different beats that they want.</p>
<p>But then they wantto put an actual graphic to that.</p>
<p>And maybe the generative is the onethat wrote the story in the first place.</p>
<p>And you're saying, okay, great.</p>
<p>For each of those beats,go out and generate an image.</p>
<p>Well, now anybody can start to makea children's picture bookor can write their ownbook or, you know, can.</p>
<p>So so I have a</p>
<p>I have a question around that thenis everything going to becomekind of whitewashed or I washed?</p>
<p>I guess the right word would be I washed.</p>
<p>We just coined word washed.</p>
<p>Right. Anyway.</p>
<p>Of what I want. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's interestingwith so I believe most thingsto be on a pendulum,you know I think there's a lot of course</p>
<p>I think what you're seeingwith the strikes that in Hollywoodis definitely going to change the kind oflevel of acceptance of some of these toolsin the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>But from a writing standpoint,from a, you know,character generation standpoint,some of the thingswhat most air doesn't do wellright now and where I thinkpeople have to startdemanding is the breadcrumb trail.</p>
<p>So tell me how to reador that email or can I look underbehind the scenes and startto understand why something was donethe way that it was done?</p>
<p>When that happens,then I actually think you're goingto see a monetization ofkind of human creative behavior.</p>
<p>You see this with Grimes, actually,she's monetize her voiceso that people can make songswith her voice and to split the revenue.</p>
<p>But what I think is going to happen,</p>
<p>I don't think it's going to lead to</p>
<p>I think really by I was sayingmaybe we made like the homogenizationof some of this stuff, which is reallydoes everything start to look the same,feel the same effects?</p>
<p>Well, that'swhat I'm worried about, right?</p>
<p>Because we've already seen I can see thishappening totally happening.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I'm using AI to generate my emails.</p>
<p>You're using AI to read my emailsand respond back.</p>
<p>So the eyes are now talking to each otherand we're looking at itcursorily and going the apps and appsand and all of a suddeneverything's everything'skind of washed out in the details.</p>
<p>But what does that. Sayabout the value of email?</p>
<p>What does that say about the value ofmaybe the thing you're working onmight not have beenthat important in the first place.</p>
