## Best Practices for Cloud Adoption

Moving to the cloud and adopting new technologies like generative AI can bring numerous benefits, but organizations must also be prepared for the changes that come with it. According to Christine McMonigal, director of Data Center and Cloud Technologies at Intel, there are key best practices to consider.

### Organizational Modernization

One important aspect to recognize is that cloud adoption is not just a technology modernization, but also an organizational modernization. This means that organizations need to be prepared for changes to processes, workflows, and even organizational structures. It's crucial to address these changes and ensure that the entire organization is aligned and prepared for the transformation.

### Identifying Barriers and Setting Clear Expectations

A crucial step in overcoming barriers and mitigating risks is identifying what these barriers are in the first place. By doing a thorough assessment of the current infrastructure, workflows, and challenges within the organization, potential roadblocks can be pinpointed and strategies can be developed to overcome them.

Moreover, setting clear expectations upfront is essential. This means effective communication with stakeholders, employees, and partners about the goals, benefits, and challenges of adopting multi-hybrid cloud strategies. By setting realistic expectations and ensuring everyone is on the same page, organizations can minimize surprises and resistance to change.

### Robust Risk Mitigation Plan

Having a robust risk mitigation plan in place is another crucial aspect of successful cloud adoption. This includes evaluating potential security risks, data privacy concerns, and compliance requirements. By proactively addressing these risks and implementing appropriate measures, organizations can safeguard their data, ensure regulatory compliance, and minimize potential threats.

## Barrier 1: Application Re-Architecture

One of the key barriers organizations often face in cloud adoption is application re-architecture. It's important to assess which applications can be lifted and shifted to the cloud as-is, and which ones may require more significant modifications. By identifying opportunities for simplification and cost reduction through automation, organizations can streamline access and controls.

## Barrier 2: Governance

Governance policies play a crucial role in mitigating risks during cloud adoption. Inconsistent security models, diverse management tools, and heterogeneous user policies can increase complexity and jeopardize the success of the migration. Simplifying governance policies and eliminating bureaucracy can help organizations streamline operations, reduce costs, and ensure data security and compliance.

## Barrier 3: Organizational Culture and Maturity

Preparing the organization for the change that comes with cloud adoption is vital. This involves getting employees on board, providing skills training, and identifying key players who can embrace the new ways of working. Addressing fears and concerns that employees may have, such as fear of being left behind or losing their jobs, is essential to create a positive and collaborative environment.

In conclusion, adopting multi-hybrid cloud strategies requires careful planning, effective communication, and a thorough understanding of an organization's goals and challenges. By addressing barriers upfront and mitigating risks, organizations can pave the way for a successful digital transformation journey.
