## The Expansive 5G Landscape and The Lonely Island Approach

The world of 5G technology is rapidly evolving, and as a result, there are a lot of insightful discussions taking place around merging Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT). Yazz Krdzalic describes the concept of the "Lonely Island approach." This approach refers to the tendency of different entities to focus too heavily on solving their individual problems, which has often led to the stalling of growth in custom hardware in telecom infrastructure. 

The need to break away from this individualistic approach and re-establish a collective architectural framework that can scale and flex with different use cases is becoming increasingly apparent. With the emergence of 5G technology, there is a need for a collaborative approach that can accommodate the various requirements of different entities. The collective approach will help to ensure that the infrastructure is flexible and scalable, making it easier for entities to integrate their technologies and applications into the network. 

The discussions around merging OT and IT are also gaining momentum, and it is becoming clear that the collaboration between these two domains is essential for the success of 5G technology. As the technology continues to evolve, it is expected that there will be more debates and discussions around how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by 5G, while also addressing the challenges posed by the emerging technology. Overall, the future of 5G technology looks bright, and the collaboration between different entities will play a critical role in its success.

## Transitioning to Zero Trust Security

As technology continues to evolve, security concerns have become a growing issue for individuals and organizations alike. In order to address these concerns and ensure a safe and secure environment, a collective architectural framework is needed. This framework includes the implementation of advanced security models, such as Zero Trust Security. However, transitioning to these models is not always easy. It requires letting go of older methods of operating and ensuring that all technological modules are synchronized and functioning properly. In the past, it was the customers who were burdened with the responsibility of integrating all the pieces. Fortunately, with the adoption of a more evolved approach, the onus of integration has been considerably reduced for the customers, making the implementation of Zero Trust Security and other advanced security models a much smoother process.

## Finding The Common Ground In 5G Usage

The development of 5G technology has been a game-changer in both commercial and military sectors. However, there are specific requirements that differentiate the commercial and military usage of 5G. Commercial deployments of private 5G networks are largely static, whereas military deployments need to be mobile. 

Leland Brown, a prominent expert in the field, has discussed the complexities of finding a common architecture that could cater to both these needs. The challenge was to create a final solution that elegantly fulfilled these requirements. It was important to ensure that the solution was efficient and effective for both commercial and military use cases. 

The development of such solutions is crucial to ensure that 5G technology is utilized to its fullest potential and can cater to the diverse needs of different industries.

## Wrapping up

The world of technology is constantly evolving and improving, and the advent of 5G technology and Zero Trust security is a testament to this. However, implementing these advancements can be challenging due to technical and cultural obstacles. Thankfully, experts like Leland Brown, Ken Urquhart, and Yaz Krdzalic are working to streamline the integration of 5G technology and Zero Trust security, making the journey towards a safer and more efficient technological future a little easier for everyone. Their insights and expertise are shedding light on the continuous journey of evolution and improvement in the world of technology.
