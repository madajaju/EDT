## CyberSecurity

The FBI has warned the public against using public phone charging stations due to the risk of cyber-attacks. These charging stations, commonly found in public places such as airports, malls, and hotels, could potentially contain malware that can compromise the security of users' personal information and devices.  Bring your own USB power adapter and you should be good to go.

## Data Management

According to OneTrust's Chief Strategy Officer, data privacy and ethics gaps pose an existential threat to organizations. Failure to adequately address these gaps can result in reputational damage, legal and financial liabilities, and loss of customer trust. Organizations must prioritize data privacy and ethics to mitigate risks and protect their businesses in the face of evolving regulatory requirements and increasing public scrutiny.

After an in-depth review of recent reports from the Government Accountability Office of the United States, Andrew Kuoh, a principal at Capgemini, has identified three key actions data organizations in the public sector must focus on. Fostering a data-driven culture, establishing data governance frameworks, and leveraging modern technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness the value of data. (People, Process, and Technology sound familiar)

IT and OT cybersecurity convergence is becoming real as more cybersecurity solutions from the IT space focus on IoT and industrial infrastructure protection. A recent example is CrowdStrikeâ€™s introduction of CloudStrike Falcon Insight for IoT. This platform brings the same tooling across IoT, IT endpoints, and cloud & data center workloads.

In a great example of taking on Industry 4.0 deployments. Volvo Group has taken on deploying a preventative maintenance IT infrastructure in its factory in Lyon, France. The Volvo Group is utilizing a Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) to enable real-time monitoring and analysis of data from factory equipment allowing for proactive preventative maintenance.
