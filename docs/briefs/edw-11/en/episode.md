## Data Management

According to OneTrust's Chief Strategy Officer, data privacy and ethics gaps pose an existential threat to organizations. Failure to adequately address these gaps can result in reputational damage, legal and financial liabilities, and loss of customer trust. Organizations must prioritize data privacy and ethics to mitigate risks and protect their businesses in the face of evolving regulatory requirements and increasing public scrutiny.

After an in-depth review of recent reports from the Government Accountability Office of the United States, Andrew Kuoh, a principal at Capgemini, has identified three key actions data organizations in the public sector must focus on. Fostering a data-driven culture, establishing data governance frameworks, and leveraging modern technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness the value of data. (People, Process, and Technology sound familiar)
