BCG just conducted one of the most comprehensive AI studies yet, surveying 13,000 people, from execs to minimum-wagers, in over 18 countries. There findings: Over 80% of leaders are using AI at work while only 20% of frontline workers are. People are more optimistic and are not much concerned about AI. Frontline workers are at risk of replacement if they do not upgrade their skills and begin using AI in their everyday work.
