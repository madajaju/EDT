This is BIG: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and other tech leaders call for a pause in the ‘out of control’ AI race. 1,100+ notable signatories just signed an open letter asking “all AI labs to pause for at least 6 months immediately”. The letter, which was also signed by the CEO of OpenAI, said the pause should apply to AI systems “more powerful than GPT-4.” It also said independent experts should use the proposed pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared protocols for AI tools that are safe “beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Google Bard with Wordle – it could have gone better. After correcting the bot and reminding it only to guess five-letter words, it apologized and returned with SLANTS, then carried on with different variations of the word SLANT ☹
