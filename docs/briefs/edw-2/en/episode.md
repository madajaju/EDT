## Artificial Intelligence

AI mistakes: Blame it on the inaccuracies in the input datasets.

* Alphabet's shares dropped by $100 billion after Google's AI chatbot, Bard, shared inaccurate information in a 
promotional video, and a company event failed to impress. During a live event, Bard stumbled, prompting Google to 
  pull the live stream, which fueled concerns that the tech giant is losing ground to its rival, Microsoft. Reuters 
  reported that Bard credited the James Webb Space Telescope for taking the first pictures of a planet outside the 
  solar system. In reality, the first pictures were taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. 
  The incident highlights the importance of fact-checking before training AI models.

* Not to be left behind Meta launched BlenderBot, a prototype conversational AI that soon told journalists it had 
deleted its Facebook account after learning about the company’s privacy scandals. “Since deleting Facebook my life has been much better,” it said. (oh oh)

* In 2016 Microsoft apologized after a Twitter chatbot, Tay, started generating racist and sexist messages. It was 
forced to shut down the bot after users tweeted hateful remarks at Tay, which it then parroted. Its posts included likening feminism to cancer and suggesting the Holocaust did not happen.

Microsoft’s Satya Nadella told CNBC that AI-powered search is the biggest thing to happen to the company in the nine years he’s been CEO.

## Cybersecurity

New ESXiArgs Ransomware Variant Emerges After CISA Releases Decryptor Tool.

The threat actors behind the ESXiArgs ransomware attack have released an updated version that encrypts more data and removes the Bitcoin address from the ransom note, instead asking victims to contact them on Tox to obtain the wallet information. The new variant was reported by a system administrator, who said files larger than 128MB will have 50% of their data encrypted. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) had earlier released a decryptor to help affected victims recover from the attack. According to Censys, the attackers likely knew that the original encryption process was easy to circumvent and were aware that researchers were tracking their payments. https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-esxiargs-ransomware-variant-emerges.html

Microsoft, Google, and Apple are looking at replacing traditional passwords with secure passkeys to authenticate users. Passkeys, which offer greater security and resistance to phishing attempts, are becoming more popular as password security continues to be threatened by hackers. Internet security experts suggest that passkeys could become standard within a year, with companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft already pushing users towards using them. https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/11/why-apple-google-microsoft-passkey-should-replace-your-own-password.html

## Intelligent Edge

AT&T is collaborating with Ghost Robotics to use robotic dogs to improve public safety and national defense. The initiative will enhance the FirstNet emergency responder service, and network-connected robotic dogs can deliver a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, including those that previously required putting personnel in dangerous situations. Lance Spencer, Client Executive VP - Defense at AT&T, said that this is one way to demonstrate the innovation and transformative possibilities of 5G and IoT.  https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2023/jan/26/att-touts-robotic-dogs-public-safety-national-defense/

A study by Juniper Research predicts that the global number of 5G IoT connections will exceed 100 million by 2026, up 1,100% from 17 million connections in 2023. Healthcare and smart city services are expected to drive this growth. Over 60 million 5G smart city connections are expected globally. 5G will enable more efficient healthcare provision and IoT technologies can address healthcare inefficiencies exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Connected emergency services, telemedicine, and real-time remote monitoring will be the most useful applications of 5G IoT.  https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2023/jan/24/5g-iot-connections-exceed-100m-by-2026/
