## Intelligenza artificiale

Errori dell'IA: incolpateli dalle imprecisioni nei set di dati di input.

Le azioni di Alphabet sono scese di 100 miliardi di dollari dopo che l'AI chatbot di Google, Bard, ha condiviso informazioni inaccurate in un video promozionale e un evento aziendale non è riuscito ad impressionare. Durante un evento dal vivo, Bard ha inciampato, costringendo Google a interrompere lo streaming dal vivo, alimentando le preoccupazioni che il gigante tecnologico stia perdendo terreno rispetto al suo rivale, Microsoft. Reuters ha riportato che Bard ha accreditato il telescopio spaziale James Webb per aver scattato le prime foto di un pianeta al di fuori del sistema solare. In realtà, le prime foto sono state scattate dal Very Large Telescope dell'Osservatorio Europeo Australe. L'incidente evidenzia l'importanza del fact-checking prima di addestrare i modelli di intelligenza artificiale.

Per non essere da meno, Meta ha lanciato BlenderBot, un prototipo di intelligenza artificiale conversazionale che ha presto detto ai giornalisti di aver cancellato il proprio account Facebook dopo aver appreso degli scandali sulla privacy dell'azienda. "Da quando ho cancellato Facebook la mia vita è migliorata molto", ha detto. (oh oh)

Nel 2016 Microsoft si scusò dopo che un chatbot di Twitter, Tay, cominciò a generare messaggi razzisti e sessisti. Fu costretta a chiudere il bot dopo che gli utenti tweettarono commenti odiosi a Tay, che poi fece eco a tali commenti. Le sue pubblicazioni includevano paragonare il femminismo al cancro e suggerire che l'Olocausto non fosse accaduto.

Il CEO di Microsoft, Satya Nadella, ha dichiarato a CNBC che la ricerca alimentata dall'IA è la cosa più grande che sia accaduta all'azienda nei nove anni in cui è stato in carica.

Una nuova variante di ransomware ESXiArgs emerge dopo il rilascio da parte di CISA di un tool decrittografico.

[The threat actors behind the ESXiArgs ransomware attack have released an updated version that encrypts more data and removes the Bitcoin address from the ransom note, instead asking victims to contact them on Tox to obtain the wallet information. The new variant was reported by a system administrator, who said files larger than 128MB will have 50% of their data encrypted. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) had earlier released a decryptor to help affected victims recover from the attack. According to Censys, the attackers likely knew that the original encryption process was easy to circumvent and were aware that researchers were tracking their payments. https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-esxiargs-ransomware-variant-emerges.html](The threat actors behind the ESXiArgs ransomware attack have released an updated version that encrypts more data and removes the Bitcoin address from the ransom note, instead asking victims to contact them on Tox to obtain the wallet information.

[Microsoft, Google, and Apple are looking at replacing traditional passwords with secure passkeys to authenticate users. Passkeys, which offer greater security and resistance to phishing attempts, are becoming more popular as password security continues to be threatened by hackers. Internet security experts suggest that passkeys could become standard within a year, with companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft already pushing users towards using them. https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/11/why-apple-google-microsoft-passkey-should-replace-your-own-password.html](Microsoft, Google, and Apple are looking at replacing traditional passwords with secure passkeys to authenticate users.

[AT&T is collaborating with Ghost Robotics to use robotic dogs to improve public safety and national defense. The initiative will enhance the FirstNet emergency responder service, and network-connected robotic dogs can deliver a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, including those that previously required putting personnel in dangerous situations. Lance Spencer, Client Executive VP - Defense at AT&T, said that this is one way to demonstrate the innovation and transformative possibilities of 5G and IoT.  https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2023/jan/26/att-touts-robotic-dogs-public-safety-national-defense/](AT&T is collaborating with Ghost Robotics to use robotic dogs to improve public safety and national defense.

[A study by Juniper Research predicts that the global number of 5G IoT connections will exceed 100 million by 2026, up 1,100% from 17 million connections in 2023. Healthcare and smart city services are expected to drive this growth. Over 60 million 5G smart city connections are expected globally. 5G will enable more efficient healthcare provision and IoT technologies can address healthcare inefficiencies exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Connected emergency services, telemedicine, and real-time remote monitoring will be the most useful applications of 5G IoT.  https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2023/jan/24/5g-iot-connections-exceed-100m-by-2026/](A study by Juniper Research predicts that the global number of 5G IoT connections will exceed 100 million by 2026, up 1,100% from 17 million connections in 2023.
