IT organizations are in the middle of a huge paradigm shift. Application developers and line of business owners are demanding agility in their IT infrastructure. IT is having a hard time keeping up and, as a result, they are losing these customers to the public cloud. CIOs are in the process of trying to change, but they are often being driven by the technology fads of the day instead of coming up with a solid strategy moving forward. A multi-hybrid cloud strategy is that solid strategy that helps satisfy the needs of the demanding application developers and line of business owners while keeping IT’s core tenants of efficiency, security and reliability. Multi-hybrid clouds give application developers what they want while still adhering to these tenets through flexibility, agility, predictive performance, efficiency, and security & compliance.
