In 1983, I discovered computers and have been driven to find ways to make them useful. The last 30 years I have created shareholder value for over 50 large and medium companies. Its been fun and I have learned a lot along the way.

With the advent of high level languages it became clear to me that given enough time and money anything was possible. I enjoy being on the leading edge of what is possible, making it simple and helping people understand the impact it can have. Pursuing a different way of doing something is exciting, hard and has the greatest potential to add value.

I discovered Blockchain in 2009 and Quantum in the last couple of years. Keeping Enterprise best practices in mind, I am very excited when I envision the possibilities of the next evolution. We launched Walacor Corporation to help people get to the next level without abandoning everything they have.
