Dedicated to automating the world&#39;s data analysis problems. World&#39;s
most prolific fantasy sports trash talker.
I founded infoSentience, which helps companies with:
• Eliminating problems with data overwhelm
• Delivering custom communications/reports on a massive scale
• Analyzing data that needs to be reported on quickly
We can do everything that a human analyst or journalist can do, but
at near infinite scale and speed
