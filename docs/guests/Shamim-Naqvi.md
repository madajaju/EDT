Experienced CEO and Co-founder with a passion for advancing the field of artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, ensuring its ethical and responsible use. I am proud to lead SafeLiShare, an innovative AI governance platform leveraging the power of confidential computing.

Our mission is to create a safer and more transparent digital ecosystem for businesses, from the inside out. With a strong academic background and over 15 years of senior-research experience at Bell Labs, I bring a deep understanding of cutting-edge technologies and their practical applications. Holding degrees in Physics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, I have honed my expertise in developing advanced algorithms and models to solve complex problems.

At SafeLiShare, we are at the forefront of the AI governance landscape, pioneering the use of confidential computing to protect sensitive data while enabling secure and collaborative/shared AI workflows. By combining the principles of privacy, transparency, and accountability, we empower organizations to harness the potential of AI while maintaining control over their data and ensuring compliance with regulations.

I actively contribute to the professional communities through speaking engagements and advisory roles. I strive to shape the future of AI governance by collaborating with industry experts, policymakers, and organizations committed to ethical AI practices.
