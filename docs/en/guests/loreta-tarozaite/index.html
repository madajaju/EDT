    <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I help companies and their leaders UNLOCK what they want the most: visibility, authority, and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I THRIVE in chaos! I see this as an opportunity for lasting transformation and impact through improved PRESENCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a brand and executive Presence strategist, I help companies achieve their business goals through cohesive and effective marketing strategies that combine the power of storytelling, video marketing, branding, digital marketing, public relations, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over two decades of expertise that started in broadcast journalism that transformed into founding my own company, and then led to working with and inside the Fortune 500 corporations, I’m your strategic partner in navigating complex world of authoritative presence. I help building marketing and communications functions that drive positive change through measurable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what am I all about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevating Presence – I help you amplify your visibility, authority, and impact by inviting you to embrace change, undergo digital transformation, and connect authentically with customers and industry peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Marketing Architect – I have a knack for identifying opportunity gaps that set the foundation for excellence. Because of my broadcast journalism background, I am good at distilling noise, detecting the hidden essence of your brand and leadership that we then convert into focused marketing, communications, and operations execution tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-Camera Coach – I enjoy empowering you - aspiring executives and startup founders - to uncover your confidence and connect with your real voice to build trust and credibility online with your customers, partners, stakeholders and investors through video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embracing Tech Innovations: I love tech. Period. I aim to always stay at the forefront of marketing, communication trends, tools, multimedia arts, and emerging technologies, including AI and mixed realities. I always look for resources that improve efficiencies and uplevel the PRESENCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Relating Lens™: This is my unique approach to communications and marketing. It’s the investigative insight to see what’s beneath the surface, to bring clarity and simplicity to complex ideas and processes, and lead the transformational change. It’s the most effective way to align People, Process and Presence to help achieve more Visibility, Authority, and Impact. The reason why it is real and relating is because of my background in video – camera never lies. I mastered the ability to “see” through and depict realness that connects through various aspects of business.TB&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Darren learns from Loreta Tarozaite as she shares her journey from a TV journalist in Lithuania to a communication expert in Silicon Valley. She discusses the common communication challenges faced by technologists, the importance of understanding one's audience, and offers a unique insight into how generative AI can assist in crafting effective messages. Loreta emphasizes the importance of presence in communication, encompassing both the nonverbal cues and authenticity. She provides insights on how to improve communication skills, especially for those for whom English is a second language.

## Takeaways

* Loreta's background in video storytelling shapes her approach to communication.

* Technologists often assume their audience understands technical jargon.

* Effective communication requires distilling complex information into digestible content.

* Visual storytelling enhances understanding and engagement.

* Presence in communication involves both authority and visibility.

* Nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in how messages are received.

* Authenticity is key; speakers should remain true to their voice.
