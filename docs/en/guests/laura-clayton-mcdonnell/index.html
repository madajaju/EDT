        <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My focus is to help my team and customers be the best that they can be. I am energized by these interactions. Learning what motivates people and helping to create a path to success is when I thrive. To be successful in sales, you must be able to build rapport and demonstrate empathy – you must have a desire to help others. And before you can help others, you must first know yourself. I encourage my team to do a deep dive into the story of their life to articulate what they value and who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 25+ year career includes some of the largest technology businesses in the world – Apple, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, and ServiceNow. My background and experience as a lawyer uniquely positions me to support customers, with the knowledge of governance and risk management and the skill sets of: critical thinking, complex negotiations, and problem solving the legal issues and concerns of a business. I have extensive experience in international business and have lived and worked abroad. My ability to connect with people across cultures and in the community is a contributing factor to my success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve earned a Bachelor of Science with Honors in International Business from San Jose State University and a J.D. and an M.B.A. in International Business and Finance from University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
