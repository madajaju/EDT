        <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stelling worked at PwC, NVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, Prophet Equity I LP, Quadrillion Partners, and others. These brands added both contacts and context to Mr. Stelling’s tools and experiences. Further, Mr. Stelling often served as the architect of the transformative digital and operational changes these companies undertook during his tenure. In addition to architecting these changes, Mr. Stelling held his various leadership positions, providing him with ample opportunity to witness and experience the importance of change management and how, when managed eﬀectively, transformation programs and rallying teams around speciﬁc initiatives can improve a company’s bottom line and future outlook. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, most of the companies where Mr. Stelling managed teams were owned by private equity funds or private investors. This provides him with a unique advantage, as he has “sat on both sides of the table,” as an executive within an organization undergoing rapid change and as an investor who sought to maximize returns to investors. He can empathize with all parties involved, giving him an advantageous sense of diplomacy and an experienced perception into the unique concerns of Middle Market companies and the challenges they face in managing eﬀective execution, adopting digital capabilities, improving operations, and expanding proﬁts.&lt;/p&gt;
