        <!-- Meta Description for SEO -->
        <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a Corporate Growth Architect with over two decades of experience in high-tech and B2B SaaS, I bring a unique blend of strategic vision, operational expertise, and coaching acumen to help organizations and individuals achieve transformative success. My proven track record includes scaling companies from zero to $500M, leading IPOs, directing 35 M&amp;amp;As, and guiding 18 profitable exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I have consistently driven substantial results in challenging environments. As CEO and Founder of Web.com (Interland), I rapidly grew the company from startup to a successful IPO on Nasdaq, driving revenue growth from $0 to $200M in ARR and achieving an astounding 500% average annual increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Executive Vice President &amp;amp; General Manager at New Relic, I managed a global team of 450+ experts and delivered $100M in new sales growth. My hands-on approach to transforming complex operations and catalyzing revenue growth has made me a sought-after partner for private equity, venture capital, and high-stakes corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I excel at leading significant operational changes, optimizing product and engineering cycles, and executing high-impact sales strategies. I adapt to the unique needs of each client to ensure tailored solutions that drive measurable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an ICF &amp;amp; CEC certified executive coach with over 15 years of experience, I draw from my extensive leadership background and deep understanding of human behavior to guide clients toward their goals. I work closely with individuals to identify unique challenges and opportunities, developing customized strategies to help them excel both professionally and personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I founded Actionable with a clear purpose: to focus on doing what I love and remove what I don’t. My passion lies in helping people solve their problems and guiding them through transformations from their current state to their desired future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my own life experiences, from growing up in a broken family home in a trailer park to taking my first company public as CEO and founder, I have unwavering confidence that anyone and any company can successfully navigate change and achieve their goals. Whether driving transformation at large companies such as Cox, public unicorns like New Relic, or startups growing from $4M to $10M in one year (and achieving an $80M+ exit), I leverage my unique combination of strategic vision, operational expertise, and coaching acumen to serve as an invaluable asset to both organizations and individuals seeking transformative growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a certified facilitator, I create dynamic and engaging learning experiences that drive meaningful change. As a sought-after keynote speaker and thought leader, I have delivered presentations at international conferences and have been featured in publications such as Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and BusinessWeek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Amazon best-selling book, “How To Business Transformation and Operational Excellence Book,” offers practical insights and strategies for leaders looking to drive change and achieve success. With a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence, I push the boundaries of what’s possible, empowering companies and leaders to achieve sustainable success.&lt;/p&gt;
