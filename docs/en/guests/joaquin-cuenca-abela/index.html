                        <h3>Pivot or Perish: A Startup’s Explosive Growth in the Age of Gen AI</h3>
                        <p class="summary">In this episode of the *Embracing Digital Transformation* podcast, host Dr. Darren sits down with special guest Joaquin Abela, CEO of Freepik, to discuss the topic of integrating generative AI into business models and the challenges of digital transformation. Joaquin shares his journey from a tech-loving young boy to leading a successful startup and dives into the significant impact that innovative technologies, such as generative AI, have had on the image licensing industry. Key points include the importance of adapting quickly to disruption, leveraging existing strengths rather than trying to compete directly with new technologies, and making strategic decisions that align with changing market demands.

## Takeaways
