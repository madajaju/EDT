        <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Betsy is a solution focused, delivery-oriented business leader. She has been a trusted advisor to senior leadership from the Department of Defense to industry C-Suite’s and Corporate Boards. Her reputation as a strategist and operational implementor has made her the “go-to” leader when decision makers need to get things done. She was an early adopter in the use of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to derive information from large, complex data sets, speeding critical insights to inform senior leader decision making. She always questions the data. Considered a cross functional problem-solver with critical thinking skills, she is a believer in the power of “silo-busting” inside organizations to deliver results. She advocates for less time in meetings (in person or on-line) and more time achieving measurable progress in business and operations. She is relentless in challenging organizations to better understand how to secure and govern their critical data by building a foundation where everyone, from the Boardroom to the Operations floor, understands where the data is and what normal data looks like. She works closely with CEOs, CDOs, CIOs, CISOs, Privacy and Compliance Officers and others to optimize use of in-house technology to strengthen business and operational needs, before buying any new technology. She is considered an insightful leadership development asset and is equally valuable when coaching or mentoring mid-management teams or individual managers. As a Business Development leader, she has been credited with identifying business challenges and opportunities “around the corner.” She appreciates the need to realize near-term revenue but not at the expense of an informed strategic plan for long-term growth. She believes that constant change is not the environment, but the new management model going forward. Awareness, Agility, Risk and Resilience are her watchwords. She is a valuable independent voice when you are looking to go beyond the status quo and need to get things done!&lt;/p&gt;
