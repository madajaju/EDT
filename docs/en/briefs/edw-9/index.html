<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>This is BIG: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and other tech leaders call for a pause in the ‚Äòout of control‚Äô AI race. 1,100+ notable signatories just signed an open letter asking ‚Äúall AI labs to pause for at least 6 months immediately‚Äù. The letter, which was also signed by the CEO of OpenAI, said the pause should apply to AI systems ‚Äúmore powerful than GPT-4.‚Äù It also said independent experts should use the proposed pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared protocols for AI tools that are safe ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt.‚Äù</p>
