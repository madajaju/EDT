            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>The AI backlash begins: Fans of Snapchat are expressing their discontent with using ChatGPT-powered bots on the platform, marking a backlash against AI. Users criticize the lack of human-like responses and the inability to differentiate between actual and AI-generated content. The incident highlights growing concerns and the need for a balanced implementation of AI in social media platforms.</p>

<p>AI-equipped eyeglasses read non-verbal/silent speech. Cornell University researchers have developed a silent-speech recognition interface that uses acoustic sensing and artificial intelligence to continuously recognize up to 31 unvocalized commands based on lip and mouth movements. The low-power, wearable interface -- EchoSpeech -- requires just a few minutes of user training data before it recognizes commands and can run on a smartphone. I swear my Grandparents knew how to do this 40 years ago. They communicated well with just a head nod, a smirk, and a smile.</p>

<p>Can AI chatbots replace bosses? A startup named Aesthetic explores the potential of AI-powered chatbots in taking over managerial tasks, offering guidance, answering questions, and managing workflows. While efficient, some argue that human qualities like empathy are irreplaceable. Is the combination of human and AI interaction the best approach for effective leadership in the workplace?</p>

<h2>CyberSecurity</h2>
<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is seeking public comments on a draft directive requiring federal agencies to attest to software security practices. The directive aims to enhance the security of software supply chains, and the comment period is open until May 3, 2023.</p>

<p>Ransomware attackers have evolved tactics, as revealed in a CrowdStrike report, resorting to coercive methods to extort payments from victims. In addition to encrypting data, these tactics involve threatening physical harm, exposing stolen information to the media, and even targeting victims&#39; families. Organizations need to stay vigilant and adapt their defenses to counter these new strategies to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks and protect their valuable data from exploitation.</p>
