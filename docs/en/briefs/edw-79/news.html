                            <h4>Off-the-Shelf Code: Ransomware&#39;s New Fuel</h4>
                            <p>Cyber Magazine suggests that off-the-shelf code may be fueling the spread of ransomware. The convenience and efficiency provided by these readily available codes make them beneficial tools for cybercriminals. They no longer need to make their malware, enabling them to launch extensive attacks. This suggests a worrying trend wherein cybercriminals might seek low-hanging fruits, such as off-the-shelf code, instead of building their tools, thereby increasing the pace of cyberattacks.</p>

                            <p>Industrial Cyber underscores the necessity for unified cybersecurity standards in Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The current divergent compliance requirements hinder the development of a cohesive national infrastructure security. By standardizing these requirements, companies can easily comply, leading to stronger defenses against cyber threats. Ultimately, this will significantly enhance the protection of our critical infrastructure and companies from attacks and security breaches.</p>
