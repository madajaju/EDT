            <h2>CyberSecurity</h2>
<p>The FBI has warned the public against using public phone charging stations due to the risk of cyber-attacks. These charging stations, commonly found in public places such as airports, malls, and hotels, could potentially contain malware that can compromise the security of users&#39; personal information and devices.  Bring your own USB power adapter and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>Google has released an urgent update for its Chrome web browser to address critical vulnerability hackers exploit. The vulnerability, identified as a &quot;use-after-free&quot; bug, could allow malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and potentially gain control over affected systems. Google has urged users to update their Chrome browsers to the latest version as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of being targeted by cyber-attacks.</p>

<h2>Data Management</h2>
<p>According to OneTrust&#39;s Chief Strategy Officer, data privacy and ethics gaps pose an existential threat to organizations. Failure to adequately address these gaps can result in reputational damage, legal and financial liabilities, and loss of customer trust. Organizations must prioritize data privacy and ethics to mitigate risks and protect their businesses in the face of evolving regulatory requirements and increasing public scrutiny.</p>

<p>After an in-depth review of recent reports from the Government Accountability Office of the United States, Andrew Kuoh, a principal at Capgemini, has identified three key actions data organizations in the public sector must focus on. Fostering a data-driven culture, establishing data governance frameworks, and leveraging modern technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness the value of data. (People, Process, and Technology sound familiar)</p>

<p>A recent webinar from a DBTA panelist discussed the importance of keeping up with the evolving needs of databases and applications in the cloud. As cloud computing advances, organizations must adapt their database and application strategies to optimize performance, security, and scalability. Emphasizing cloud-native technologies, automation, and best practices can help businesses stay ahead in today&#39;s dynamic cloud environment.</p>

<h2>Intelligent Edge</h2>
<p>Edge Computing Expo North America, scheduled for 17-18 May 2023, has recently announced a star-studded lineup of technologists and business leaders in the IOT space. The conference will be held at the Santa Clara Convention Center in California. You have got to put this one on your calendar.</p>

<p>IT and OT cybersecurity convergence is becoming real as more cybersecurity solutions from the IT space focus on IoT and industrial infrastructure protection. A recent example is CrowdStrike’s introduction of CloudStrike Falcon Insight for IoT. This platform brings the same tooling across IoT, IT endpoints, and cloud &amp; data center workloads.</p>

<p>In a great example of taking on Industry 4.0 deployments. Volvo Group has taken on deploying a preventative maintenance IT infrastructure in its factory in Lyon, France. The Volvo Group is utilizing a Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) to enable real-time monitoring and analysis of data from factory equipment allowing for proactive preventative maintenance.</p>
