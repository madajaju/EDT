                            <p>The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved a voluntary cybersecurity labeling program for wireless consumer IoT products. The initiative aims to help consumers identify secure devices through a &#34;US Cyber Trust Mark.&#34; This label, accompanied by a QR code with security details, incentivizes manufacturers to enhance cybersecurity standards. The program will involve public-private collaboration, with the FCC overseeing and third-party administrators managing the labeling process. The move addresses growing cybersecurity concerns as the number of IoT devices rises.</p>
