                    <h3>Mastering AI in Defense Operations</h3>
                    <p>In a recent episode of Embracing Digital Transformation, we dove headfirst into the fascinating world of data management and artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on their role in defense and operations. We had the privilege of hosting retired Rear Admiral Ron Fritzemeier, a veteran in this field, who shared his insights and intriguing experiences. Remember to check out the latest ED-T fish cam this week. Darren had to replace the old ED-T with a new one. Check out the new ED-T, GenAI, and the Fish and Snail duo mascots for the Embracing Digital Transformation podcast.</p>

                            <p>Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity is becoming essential for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). With increasing cyber threats targeting industrial systems, experts emphasize the need for CISOs to integrate OT cybersecurity into their overall strategies. These systems are often less guarded than IT environments, making them attractive targets. Addressing these vulnerabilities can mitigate risks and protect critical infrastructure from escalating cyberattacks that could have severe consequences.</p>
