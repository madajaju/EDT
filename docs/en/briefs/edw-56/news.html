                <h3>Adapting Education: A Digital Transformation Success</h3>
                <p>Darren interviewed Dan Berges, the Managing Director and Founder of Berges Institute, about his experience with digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, Dan&#39;s in-person Spanish language training school was shut down in the early days of the crisis. However, within weeks of the shutdown, the school was able to successfully transition to a fully online platform. Not only did this save the school, but it also led to an increase in the number of students enrolled.</p>
