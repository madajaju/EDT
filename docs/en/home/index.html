                    <h3>Bridging the AI Implementation Gap</h3>
                    <p>In the latest episode of &#39;Embracing Digital Transformation&#39;, Dr. Darren is joined by two AI luminaries: Lynn Comp from Intel and Russell Fishman from NetApp. Together, they delve into three major themes: the gap between AI pilots and production-ready systems. They highlight that while many organizations experiment with AI, few successfully scale their efforts to generate consistent value across the enterprise. The conversation distinguishes between ‘experimental AI’ and ‘enterprise AI’—the latter requiring rigorous architecture, governance, and ROI, as well as securing intellectual property and data in AI pipelines. Protecting sensitive data is non‑negotiable when deploying AI at scale. The trio outlines best practices for safeguarding models and ensuring data integrity, from on-premises and hybrid environments to cloud systems, and building a resilient enterprise-grade AI framework. They emphasize the importance of robust infrastructure, data interoperability, and strategic vendor partnerships. The Intel–NetApp collaboration shines as a model, offering integrated tools that streamline secure development, deployment, and scaling.</p>
