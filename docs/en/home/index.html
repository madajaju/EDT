                    <h3>AI&#39;s Impact on Business Transformation</h3>
                    <p>This week on Embracing Digital Transformation, now ranked #1 on Apple Podcasts in the Technology category, host Dr. Darren Pulsipher opens the show with a heartfelt thank you to our listeners for making it happen. After a United Airlines tech meltdown stranded him and caused him to miss an important business trip, Darren still managed a fun movie night with Paige — and, in a rare twist, stayed awake the whole time. In the main segment, Darren welcomes Andrew Brooks — co-founder of SmartThings, accomplished entrepreneur, and record-setter for running seven marathons on seven continents in just seven days. Together, they explore how artificial intelligence is transforming business: helping companies break into new markets, streamline operations, and reimagine traditional processes. They tackle the challenges of AI integration, the critical importance of human oversight, and how starting small can build trust while reducing employee fears. The takeaway? AI success depends as much on culture and strategy as it does on technology. This episode is made possible by Contextual IO — proud sponsor of Embracing Digital Transformation.</p>
