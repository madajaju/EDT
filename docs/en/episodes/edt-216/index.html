    <p>Tech and business leaders alike know that with increased reliance on digital systems and devices comes the potential for catastrophic outages, like the most significant IT outage in history, significantly disrupting services across several sectors. In a recent podcast episode, industry experts Darren Pulsipher and Steve delved into the driving factors behind such major system failures and how businesses can build more resilient technology platforms to withstand these challenges better.</p>
<h2>Improved Resilience through DevSecOps</h2>
<p>The conversation delved into the critical role of DevSecOps, which involves seamlessly integrating security measures throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to coding to testing to deployment. It was emphasized that this holistic approach ensures that security is not an afterthought but rather an integral part of the development process, aligning with the principles of DevOps. While discussing the challenges, the experts pointed out that the continuous deployment of updates, particularly configuration files, can sometimes conflict with the meticulous testing and security measures advocated by DevSecOps. This conflict underscores the need to balance agility and robust security protocols within the DevOps framework.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the conversation emphasized that the primary objective of DevSecOps is not just to detect and troubleshoot issues after deployment; instead, the focus is on proactively preventing system failures by identifying and rectifying potential vulnerabilities during the development phase. This aligns with the overarching goal of DevSecOps, which is to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility across development and operations teams. By proactively addressing security concerns at every stage of the software development process, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of system crashes and ensure their systems&#39; overall robustness and reliability.</p>
<h2>Incorporating Chaos Monkey practices</h2>
<p>Darren and Steve have introduced an intriguing concept with their introduction of &quot;Chaos Monkey&quot; practices, advocating for its integration into the DevOps process. This method emphasizes stress-testing techniques like the random removal of services to pinpoint weak points within operations. By implementing this approach, companies can proactively enhance resilience by consistently updating products and infrastructure to effectively handle any potential chaos that may arise in the future.</p>
<p>The &quot;Chaos Monkey&quot; methodology is a proactive strategy to fortify operations against potential disruptions. By stress-testing systems through methods like random service removal, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and take preemptive measures to bolster their resilience. This continuous improvement ensures companies are better equipped to handle unforeseen challenges, resulting in more robust and reliable operations.</p>
<h2>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Process</h2>
<p>During the discussion on recovery strategies, Darren and Steve stressed the importance of implementing a comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plan that encompasses the entire organization rather than focusing solely on individual systems. They highlighted the significance of preparedness to convey its importance to the audience. One of the suggestions was the utilization of automated systems that can spring into action immediately following a system crash, thereby reducing the reliance on human intervention and guesswork.</p>
<p>Additionally, they delved into the capabilities of Intel-based Active Management Technology (AMT), which enables secure access to crashed systems over the network for recovery and updates. The emphasis on leveraging such technological advancements reflects the vital role that automated systems and advanced technologies play in enhancing disaster recovery and business continuity processes, ultimately contributing to organizations&#39; resilience and stability.</p>
<p>The key takeaway of the conversation was the necessity for businesses to prioritize building resilience in their technology processes and teams. This requires a forward-thinking approach and the integration of effective changes leveraging people, processes, and technology. The need for adaptability is stressed, as is creating an intricate balance between speed, agility, and rigorous testing. With adequate preparation and resilience, businesses can be ready to tackle future disruptions head-on. </p>
