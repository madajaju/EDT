            <p>In this episode, Darren talks about the history of applications and how recent changes, primarily due to the onslaught</p>
<p>of data from the Internet of Things, is affecting data-centric architectures. The infrastructure is ready, but we don’t</p>
<p>yet have a suitable way to manage all our data. There are three elements that need to change to facilitate this process:</p>
<p>people (organization), process (operation), and architecture (technology). Darren focuses on the architecture where data</p>
<p>and compute are spread over thousands of edge devices and across public and private clouds.</p>
<h2>Purpose Built Hardware-software Stacks</h2>
<p>How we deploy applications for missions today has not changed significantly in thirty years. A reference architecture</p>
<p>that has an application and application stack is built on specific hardware, with compute and storage connected to a</p>
<p>network. This model worked well for a long time, and in fact, about a quarter of applications are still being deployed</p>
<p>on purpose-built hardware, but it is not optimal today. Technology moves too fast for this model; drifts happen. In</p>
<p>addition, there are long development times, high costs, limited re-use of the technology, and lack of integration with</p>
<p>other applications.</p>
<h2>Virtualization Architectures</h2>
<p>About 20 – 25 years ago, hardware virtualization began to resolve some of these issues with the ability to deploy</p>
<p>multiple applications on one machine. Applications were no longer tied to specific hardware. Instead of buying five</p>
<p>smaller machines, one larger piece of hardware could be used, not just for compute, but for virtual storage and network</p>
<p>functions as well, leading to greater cost-effectiveness. As with any development, this raised some new issues:</p>
<p>increased security concerns and “noisy neighbors,” meaning one application interfering with the performance of another</p>
<p>because of using up IO bandwidth, network, or storage, etc..</p>
<h2>Cloud Architectures</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, cloud technology took off. We could now share across multiple organizations. Where virtualization</p>
<p>created abstraction of hardware, cloud technology created abstraction of operations, making it easier to manage multiple</p>
<p>machines. The cloud architectural idea created “software defined infrastructure,” which makes it easier to spin up and</p>
<p>spin down compute, storage and network resources. Other benefits are decreased CapEx and OpEx costs, due to less</p>
<p>hardware and manpower. It also gave bursting ability, for example, for retailers during the busy holiday season or the</p>
<p>government during the census. With the progression of this technology, the issues of security and noisy neighbors</p>
<p>increased because of multiple tenants on the same machine. Another concern is integration costs between public and</p>
<p>private clouds. Even with these worries, however, the pros far outweigh the cons in most cases.</p>
<h2>Service and Container Architectures</h2>
<p>Over the last five to six years, we’ve seen the reinvention of an old technology: containerization. Docker created an</p>
<p>easier way to use the previously clunky and difficult-to-use container technology. Application developers, in</p>
<p>particular, embraced this technology because it is consistent across multiple environments. The service management layer</p>
<p>with containerization of applications and microservices is more application-centric and maps those applications to</p>
<p>generic, virtualized hardware that’s been abstracted away. We now have automatic deployment across multiple clouds,</p>
<p>we’ve optimized OpEx and also CapEx on the application stack and service stack layer. Fault tolerance is automated, and</p>
<p>it’s much easier to integrate with overlay networks, integrate across multiple clouds, create firewalls, do</p>
<p>micro-segmentation etc… all via software.</p>
<p>Security, however, is a primary concern. Since containers are easy to deploy across multiple environments, it’s</p>
<p>important to focus on security that is “built-in” to the deployment. Also, there is an increase in complexity. Here,</p>
<p>we’ve moved away from a three-tier architecture to a multi-tier or even a micro-service architecture with dozens of</p>
<p>services working together. Another problem is where and how the data is stored and managed. On the service management</p>
<p>layer, storage is a generic container, which doesn’t manage the data itself.</p>
<h2>Internet of Things Architectures</h2>
<p>Now, when Internet of Things (IoT) is added to this ecosystem, the increased volume of data is spread across hundreds or</p>
<p>thousands of smart devices. It also increases visibility, but this creates additional security concerns. Many edge</p>
<p>devices are accessible by the public. For example, someone could tamper with a smart city light, a smart traffic signal,</p>
<p>a drone, or security camera. The complexity of the different devices, their number and locations, along with the immense</p>
<p>amount of data, is enormous.</p>
<h2>Data and Information Management Architectures</h2>
<p>How do we work through these issues? Organizations are already changing to handle this complexity with new organizations</p>
<p>and positions foxing on data management use cases. Previously, there was no place for these use cases to be managed, so</p>
<p>we’ve created a new key layer called the distributed information management layer. This layer manages data across all of</p>
<p>the IoT, Legacy, and public and private clouds. It matches the data with application stacks and service stacks, so we</p>
<p>can dynamically allocate services and applications close to the data, or visa versa. Regulations and sheer size of data</p>
<p>can limit the ability to move data to central locations, as we have done traditionally. With this new architecture,</p>
<p>several modes of operations can be utilized including disaggregated analytics, data movement and application movement.</p>
<p>Once again, with this expanded architecture, security is of utmost importance. Security needs to run as a common aspect</p>
<p>through all the layers. Identity security, meaning access, authorization, and authentication of individuals, IOT</p>
<p>devices, applications, services, and even of data is key. Management of identity includes encryption for trusted data</p>
<p>and devices.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of this architecture together is called the Edgemere architecture. Many of the parts already exist; we need to</p>
<p>optimize how they work together. The newest area is the distributed information management layer (DIML). Fortunately, we</p>
<p>are beginning to see start-ups and more established companies building out the use cases and the architectural elements</p>
<p>in this layer.</p>
<p>The Edgemere architecture helps identify the key moving parts of a modern digitally transformed system and how they all</p>
<p>fit together.</p>
<p>Intel fits into this ecosystem by providing the key element of a common physical layer to control and manage all of your</p>
<p>resources, whether it’s an IOT device, in the data center, or in a remote location. We make it possible for you to</p>
<p>efficiently move the data, store it effectively, and process everything. Whether it’s the Xeon processors at the high</p>
<p>end, or whether it’s doing inference or AI on the edge at very low power, Intel has a full stack of physical hardware.</p>
